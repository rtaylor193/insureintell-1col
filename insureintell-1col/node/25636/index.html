<!--break--><!--break-->

<p><em>My personal comments are in italics.</em></p>

<p><em>Here are the tabulated replies. </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Part One: Auditing Underwriters (Excluding Reinsurer Audits) </strong></h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. How often to you audit your underwriters?</p>

<p>Number of Companies Response</p>

<ul>
	<li>15 Monthly</li>
	<li>11 Quarterly</li>
	<li>9 Semi-annually</li>
	<li>4 Annually</li>
	<li>2 Continuously*</li>
	<li>2 Varies by level</li>
	<li>1 Weekly</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*One wonders if they do much else! </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Do you perform these audits internally or outsource this function</p>

<ul>
	<li>Internally 44</li>
	<li>Outsource 1*</li>
</ul>

<p><em>* Brisk market for us consultants! </em></p>

<p><em>Is it always wise not to get a “second opinion” from experts when so much is on the line? Reinsurer feedback can be outstanding but you also have to consider that their agenda and yours are not necessarily the same. The value of independent opinions, especially in the age of Compliance Departments, has its merits</em>!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. Do you undertake training for underwriters based on ﬁndings from audits?</p>

<ul>
	<li>YES 38</li>
	<li>NO 7*</li>
</ul>

<p>*<em>Why would any company do audits and then not use the results for training? </em></p>

<p><em>Maybe they spend all their time producing with little or no training and just grow more and more out of touch with each passing day? </em></p>

<p><em>Rumor has it there are such “sweat shops” out there, to the distress of their mortality and morbidity. “Pay me now or pay me later,” eh? </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. Other than those focused solely on billing or time service, do you undertake audits of your service providers?</p>

<ul>
	<li>YES 20</li>
	<li>NO 25*</li>
</ul>

<p>*<em>Considering what is at stake, one would think ALL companies would do some kind of assessment of the “bang” they’re getting for lots of bucks! Maybe it is simply a matter of time and staff…in which case, know that some of us can help out here. Us “ex-vendor” types have eagle eyes! </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A. If YES, which services to you audit? Please check all that apply:</p>

<ul>
	<li>17 Paramedicals</li>
	<li>13 Laboratory testing services</li>
	<li>10 APS collection services</li>
	<li>3 “complaints, other, not sure which”</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Part Two: Teleunderwriting </strong></h2>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>1. Are you actively using teleinterviews with drilldown questions?</p>

<ul>
	<li>YES 31</li>
	<li>NO 14*</li>
</ul>

<p>If NO, skip down to Part Three and continue.</p>

<p><em>*If these 14 are not scurrying RIGHT NOW to get started, they are destined to “wake up” in the very near future when “top brass” come down to visit and ask why competitors are doing more, for less, faster… and stealing away their producers in the process. Not a very pleasant thought. It won’t be long before conventional underwriting is obsolete, save for, perhaps, the very largest cases, and then mainly at older ages and in the substandard market only. </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Do you perform all teleinterviews inhouse, outsource them all to a service provider or do both in-house and outsourced interviews?</p>

<ul>
	<li>13 Outsource all*</li>
	<li>9 Inhouse all</li>
	<li>9 Both outsource and inhouse**</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*This split is probably narrower than it is industry-wide. My take is that at least 75% of companies outsource entirely. These results are skewed toward inhouse because of the relatively larger size of respondents. </em></p>

<p><em>** This approach has gained favor of late. Good way to compare which approach produces the best protective value and “cost vs. beneﬁt.” </em><br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>If y</strong><strong>ou outsource some or all of your teleinterviews: </strong></p>

<p>1. Do you use one of the “Big Three” providers (EMSI, LabOne or Portamedic) or another ﬁrm?</p>

<ul>
	<li>15 One of the “Big Three”*</li>
	<li>7 Another ﬁrm</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*This result may be skewed a bit by the presence of a handul of health companies in the survey, who are more apt to use “other” ﬁrms because of concern for perceived “special needs” (which I remain convinced are not all that special!) </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Do you audit your outsourced teleinterviews for quality and/or for time service?</p>

<p>Quality</p>

<ul>
	<li>YES 17</li>
	<li>NO 5*</li>
</ul>

<p>Time Service</p>

<ul>
	<li>YES 11</li>
	<li>NO 11*</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*Ok, in a ﬁreﬁght, quality is more important than time service (but not by much). Still, how can you put so much of your mortality/morbidity bottom line in the hands of outsourced providers and not AT LEAST audit the quality of what you get back? This raises issues about the competence of underwriting management in my view. </em></p>

<p><em>And how can 50% of respondents say that they will stand soundlessly with their mouths open when their boss asks how long it takes to get the interviews done? </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. How satisﬁed are you with the overall quality of outsourced teleinterviews?</p>

<ul>
	<li>15 Very</li>
	<li>7 Somewhat</li>
	<li>0 Not at all</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. How satisﬁed are you with the time service of outsourced teleinterviews?</p>

<ul>
	<li>15 Very</li>
	<li>7 Somewhat</li>
	<li>0 Not at all</li>
</ul>

<p><em>I wonder if these boxes were not simply checked without a lot of thought (or database with which to reply) by at least some survey respondents. </em></p>

<p><em>To know if you are satisﬁed or not, you need to look! Again, where quality is concerned, the impact of unfavorable interview quality could be disastrous (APS reports ordered where not need, not ordered where truly needed, bad decisions). </em></p>

<p><em>One critical aspect I should have asked about is how companies generate their drilldown scripts. I know from experience that almost none of them use generics provided by service ﬁrms. But, do they optimize the quality of their scripts? Along with the capabilities of the teleinterviewers, this is where the buck stops. Garbage in – Garbage out and vice versa. </em><br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>If you do some or all of your teleinterviews inhouse: </strong></p>

<p>1. Do you audit them for quality?</p>

<ul>
	<li>YES 11</li>
	<li>NO 7</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Do you audit the turnaround time?</p>

<ul>
	<li>YES 16</li>
	<li>NO 2</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. Do you provide ongoing training for your teleinterviewers?</p>

<ul>
	<li>YES 11</li>
	<li>NO 7</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Egad, how can turnaround time outperform quality by 3 to 1? Where are our priorities? Quality is #1. </em></p>

<p><em>Period. </em></p>

<p><em>I have seen the effects of training for teleinterviewers. I have also seen the quality of work done by untrained people who have no clue what they are asking about or why they are asking. It is beyond silly to expect to get high quality interviews unless you provide AT LEAST the basics (interviewing skills, medical vocabulary, insights into what the key questions are trying to get at and so on). </em></p>

<p><em>40% of companies with inhouse teleinterviewers provide NO ONGOING TRAINING? Lord have mercy… </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. Do you telecommute some or all teleinterviewers or are they all based in your company ofﬁce(s)?</p>

<ul>
	<li>5 Telecommute some or all*</li>
	<li>0 All housed in company ofﬁces</li>
	<li>3 NO REPLY (?)</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*Bravo! It is time to recognize the substantial paybacks from telecommuting both teleinterviewers and underwriters! </em></p>

<p><em>This is a gem of an idea, especially for companies that have limited talent available loco-regionally. I am frankly surprised that more carriers are not doing this. It is cheaper in the long run, so if nothing else it should get the CFOs smiling (sigh). </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A. If you telecommute, how do you rate the quality of telecommuted interviews to those done inhouse?</p>

<ul>
	<li>4 Superior*</li>
	<li>1 Equal</li>
	<li>0 Inferior</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*Hey: to all non-telecommuting companies! This has been a consistent response I have personally heard from both life and health companies that actively use telecommuting of underwriters! The ﬁxed-false-belief that people who telecommute will shortchange the company is approaching delusional. The best thing that ever happened to AOL, service-wise and in my opinion, is when they went from inhouse service people answering the phones to people in India doing it. The quality (and the cordiality) improved 200%! </em></p>

<p><em>I have GRAVE reservations about telecommuting (or outsourcing to) people in India when it comes to actual underwriting functions…but I honestly would not rule out telecommuting/outsourcing the teleinterviewing function to India (where the oral grammar. diction and demeanor I have heard could well be a role model for some here in the USA!) until I saw it in action. Of course, you would have to solve some training logistics but it could be well worth the investment. </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Which of these best describes your inhouse teleinterviewers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>6 Interviews done by underwriters, who also underwrite the case*</li>
	<li>6 Interviews done by others who are trained for this function and do not perform other call-center type functions</li>
	<li>5 Interviews done by others who also undertake other call center functions**</li>
	<li>1 Interviews done by RNs or equivalent***</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*Several of these are health companies where this practice works MUCH BETTER than it does on the life side. </em></p>

<p><em>Thankfully, the prevalence of using underwriters to call and underwrite is low – and declining – by my count among life insurers!</em></p>

<p><em>** Careful! This is fraught with problems unless these folks get some specialized education and close auditing. It is one thing to ask questions about inforce services or inquire about late payments…it is quite another to do teleunderwriting drilldowns. Sometimes what looks “cheap” turns out to very, very costly!</em></p>

<p><em>Garbage in… </em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>***Why is there just one lonely company in this cohort? </em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Whom better than a nurse?</em></p>

<p><em>She (mainly – but not always) has worked with two of the most difﬁcult genre of humans in business – patients and doctors – and has the medical vocabulary, Rx ﬂuency and other elements you need to train lay folks in. I would think that telecommuting RNs who are home with young kids or want to work part-time would be a windfall opportunity! Maybe this is because I worked for some great years with a team of RNs at my “alma mater,” who were among the sharpest and most competent folks I have ever known in 3.5 decades in this industry! </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. Do you actively encourage your underwriters to give feedback on teleinterviews and drilldowns on an individual case basis?</p>

<ol>
	<li>YES 22</li>
	<li>NO 9*</li>
</ol>

<p><em>*Earth to the lonely 9 – c’mon…this is too good to pass up! </em><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Part Three: Pharmaceutical Database Services</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note: Excluding one respondent that does business only in Canada, where this service is not as yet available. </strong></p>

<p>1. Do you currently use a pharmaceutical database service?</p>

<ul>
	<li>NO 27</li>
	<li>YES 14*</li>
	<li>CURRENTLY EVALUATING 3</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*Actually, this is a higher percentage than I expected. Good. My view on these databases is changing from anti- to pro- the more I see. They are not perfect. What is? If they add cost-effective value, they have to be considered objectively</em>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. If NO, Which of the following best describes your experience with these services to date?</p>

<ul>
	<li>9 We have never evaluated them</li>
	<li>17* We evaluated them and found that they did not provide sufﬁcient value based on cost vs. beneﬁt<br />
	<br />
	1 No answer</li>
</ul>

<p><em>*I have been privy to 4 such “evaluations” and only one of them was solid by my standards. You cannot evaluate this service objectively unless you know something about pharmacology. As someone who does, I know that if you misunderstand the relation between a given Rx and a matched underwriting scenario, you will inevitably botch your assessment of protective value and thus “cost vs. beneﬁt.” Do it right or don’t do it. I Should add my phone number (!). </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. If YES, How would you rate the value of this service?</p>

<ul>
	<li>4 Provides great value</li>
	<li>3 Provides adequate value</li>
	<li>7* Does not provide adequate value</li>
</ul>

<p><em>* As I was just saying… Besides, there have been real enhancements in these services. An evaluation done a year ago is not sufﬁcient any longer. More than a year, forget it. Junk. </em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>COMMENTS on Question # 3 </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Our legal department bars their use</li>
</ul>

<p><em>“Seek and ye shall receive…” </em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Very impressed with service now</li>
	<li>Too much “noise” – nothing screened or sorted</li>
</ul>

<p><em>If there is an Achilles’ heel, this would be it. But then, I don’t want anyone but “me” (as chief underwriter) saying when Rx matters. Every time I have seen this done, it has been done wrong. Underwriting (and more so TELEUNDERWRITING) is about connecting all the dots. </em></p>

<p><em>Missing dots = mistakes waiting to happen. </em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Insured often says he is on Rx not shown on records</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Ouch! But remember, not all drugs come through these pipelines. If you pay cash, for example, forget it. If you buy outside the states, ditto. If you get Rx via a government program, likewise (best as I know). There is no way this service can be 100% spot on…but then, which service is? Besides, I’ll take a “false negative” any day over a “false positive” in this context. </em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Use only on “clean” DI cases, reinstatements and claims</li>
</ul>

<p><em>And, so, if it works, then what? </em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Teleinterviews provide enough Rx information</li>
</ul>

<p><em>They do a wonderous job. Compared to agents and parameds, it is a “no brainer” in favor of (quality) teleinterviews…but these database services also function in a “false-safe” mode with teleunderwriting, for those occasional “memory lapses” of signiﬁcance! </em></p>

<p><em>Fact is, I would bury all my biases both ways and test out the resource, then decide. Call it a lesson learned the hard way by an old man. </em></p>
