<p><strong>What is body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)?</strong></p>

<p><em>“BDD is characterized by an obsession with some aspect of physical appearance that is, to objective viewers, quite normal. If there is indeed some objective defect in appearance, the sufferer’s concern is considered excessive. Almost any aspect of appearance can be the focus of concern.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>David J. Castle, MSc, MD et al.<br />
University of Melbourne, Australia<br />
<em>Psychiatric Clinics of North America</em><br />
29(2006):521</p>
</blockquote>
<!--break--><!--break-->

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>When was BDD first recognized as a discrete entity?</strong></p>

<p>1987.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What are the diagnostic criteria for BDD in the latest edition of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV-TR)?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Preoccupation with an imagined defect in appearance. If a modest defect is present, then excessive concern over that defect.</li>
	<li>Preoccupation causes significant distress affecting functioning.</li>
	<li>Preoccupation cannot be explained by some other psychiatric illness.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What causes BDD?</strong></p>

<p>No one knows for sure. There is some evidence of familial aggregation and also a link between BDD and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). [Bienvenu]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How common is BDD?</strong></p>

<p>A 1999 study pegged prevalence at 1-2%. [Hollander]</p>

<p>A brand new study based on a national household survey of 2,513 adults found that 2.5% of women and 2.2% of men met the BDD criteria, which was greater than for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder I, and equal to generalized anxiety disorder.</p>

<p>They also reported that prevalence declined significantly after age 44, and that a larger portion of affected persons were unmarried. [Koran]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Is BDD mainly a “Western” disorder?</strong></p>

<p>No – it is as common in parts of Asia although it may present with a different focus (eyelids, for example, in Japan).</p>

<p>BDD seems to be more or less equally prevalent in most populations, worldwide. [Castle]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Is BDD more common in females?</strong></p>

<p>Experts differ on this, based on their studies.</p>

<p>One says it is 2:1 female. [Phillips and Pagano] Another concludes it is basically 1:1 (equal) between genders. [Castle]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Is there a specific male subtype?</strong></p>

<p>Yes – referred to by various terms including “bigorexia,” “Adonis complex” and “muscle dysmorphia.” As you might guess, the issue here is that the subject worries he is too thin or puny.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What areas of the body are the focus of preoccupation in BDD?</strong></p>

<p>Just about every part that could possibly matter cosmetically, especially the face, breasts (women), excessive hair, nose shape, teeth, weight, genitalia, skin and so on. [Hunt]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Is BDD usually diagnosed when a patient presents with significant evidence of this disorder?</strong></p>

<p><em>“BDD is commonly missed, dismissed and misdiagnosed in most medical settings. Numerous studies have illustrated the rarity of a BDD diagnosis being included on a patient’s problem list, even when looking at mental health records.”</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thomas J. Hunt, MD, et al.<br />
University of Nevada<br />
<em>American Family Physician</em><br />
78(2008):217</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No doubt you will see obvious BDD cases when reviewing psychiatric medical records; cases not cited as BDD by the physicians.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Do BDD patients often go directly to specialists to air their concerns?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, and the range of specialists to whom they first present is rather broad:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Dermatologists</li>
	<li>Cosmetic surgeons</li>
	<li>Dentists</li>
	<li>Psychiatrists</li>
</ul>

<p>In one study, 20% of patients with BDD expressed concerns with their dental appearance, seeking out dentists and maxillofacial surgeons. [Naini]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What are the clinical manifestations of BDD?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Overall, #1 is fixation on a body part with concern for its appearance.</li>
	<li>Frequent checking of the “defect,” even with special lighting and magnification.</li>
	<li>Excessive grooming.</li>
	<li>Avoidance of mirrors; not having mirrors in the home*.</li>
	<li>Excessive exercise, including weightlifting. Perhaps there is some anabolic steroid abuse in this context, as we known these drugs are used for physical appearance enhancement by adolescents.</li>
	<li>Frequent changing of clothes.</li>
	<li>Attempts to camouflage the “defect.”</li>
	<li>Concern that the “defective” body part is extremely fragile.</li>
	<li>Avoidance of social settings, sometimes to the point of extreme isolation and being housebound.</li>
	<li>Going out at night only*.</li>
	<li>Working at jobs below their capacity to avoid public contact.</li>
	<li>Missing work, school.</li>
	<li>Frequent use of cosmetics.</li>
	<li>Many visits to a variety of physicians seeking help.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is one more BDD feature of special interest because of its prevalence: skin picking…which is found in 45% of BDD patients (especially females with comorbid trichotillomania and/or a personality disorder). [Grant]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What are the most prevalent comorbidities in BDD? [Hunt, Perugi, Veale]</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Obsessive-compulsive anxiety disorder</li>
	<li>Anorexia nervosa</li>
	<li>Major depressive disorder</li>
	<li>Atypical depression</li>
	<li>Social anxiety disorder</li>
	<li>Panic disorder</li>
	<li>Bulimia nervosa</li>
	<li>Bipolar I disorder</li>
	<li>Substance abuse</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, one study found that 3 out of 4 BDD patients met the criteria for a personality disorder. [Veale]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How common is major depression in BDD?</strong></p>

<p>In one study, 38% had comorbid MDD, mainly of a melancholic nature.</p>

<p>Onset of BDD typically came first. And those with both BDD and MDD were more prone to MDD relapses, as well as higher suicidality. [Phillips and Didie]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How do BDD and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) differ?</strong></p>

<p>OCD and BDD have so many similarities that some experts believe BDD should be included in the obsessive-compulsive disorder spectrum, together with Tourette syndrome and trichotillomania.</p>

<p>However, they also differ in ways which clearly make BDD the worse insurance risk: [Phillips and Pinto]</p>

<ul>
	<li>Poorer insight into their disorder and a much greater risk of delusional behavior</li>
	<li>Higher lifetime risk of suicidality</li>
	<li>Greater prevalence of major depression</li>
	<li>More often affected by substance abuse, especially alcohol use disorders</li>
	<li>Greater overall morbidity</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How commonly are eating disorders comorbid with BDD?</strong></p>

<p>Ruffalo found that 32.5% of BDD patients had a lifetime eating disorder, with anorexia twice as common as bulimia nervosa. [Ruffolo]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Is substance abuse also significantly more prevalent than in the general population?</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely!</p>

<p>In a cohort of 176 consecutive BDD patients, 29% met criteria for alcohol dependence (alcoholism). [Grant and Menard]</p>

<p>We need to point out here than the BDD cases seen clinically are almost certainly the worst ones. In the community among undiagnosed cases, or those treated in primary care, undoubtedly the prevalence of these other disorders, especially mood and substance abuse, are lower. Nevertheless, the risk is clearly there and needs to be ascertained.</p>

<p>BDD patients should be regarded with concern if they have findings associated with alcohol or drug abuse. These would include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Isolated elevations of GGT</li>
	<li>Very high HDL-C</li>
	<li>Adverse motor vehicle records even without alcohol-related convictions</li>
	<li>Frequent emergency department visits, especially nocturnal, on weekends and/or due to accidents</li>
	<li>Excessive trauma events overall</li>
	<li>Heavy cigarette smoking and/or coffee consumption</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Is there a psychotic subset in BDD?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the so-called “delusional form,” which is less common and more severe. However, the delusional patients often respond to conventional antidepressants and only a minority need antipsychotics (they being the worst risks, of course). [Phillips, 2004]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What characteristics have been identified in the delusional (psychotic) BDD form? [Phillips and Menard]</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Lower educational attainment</li>
	<li>Higher suicide attempt risk</li>
	<li>Poorer social functioning</li>
	<li>Higher risk of alcohol and drug abuse/dependence</li>
	<li>Less likely to be receiving mental health care</li>
	<li>More severe BDD symptoms</li>
	<li>However, remission rates about the same as in more prevalent non-delusional cases</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What medications are used most often in BDD? [Castle, Hunt]</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake blockers), especially fluoxetine, paroxetine, citalopram and escitalopram</li>
	<li>Fluvoxamine, which is also an SSRI but used mainly for OCD and other anxiety disorders rather than depression in the USA</li>
	<li>Clomipramine, which is mainly used in OCD</li>
</ul>

<p>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors, non-SSRI antidepressants and other drugs are far less effective overall.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What is the extent of the typical BDD patient’s response to medication?</strong></p>

<p>Not all that good…</p>

<p>In one study, only 25% attained remission in one year. However, this increased to 60% after 4 years. The relapse rate was 29%. It should be noted that these patients were cared for by experts in the field, who would be expected to fare better in terms of inducing and sustaining remission than other mental healthcare providers. [Phillips and Grant]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Is psychotherapy also used?</strong></p>

<p>Yes…and it has been said to be more effective than medication overall. [Castle, Hunt]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What % of patients seeking cosmetic surgery have BDD?</strong></p>

<p>5-15%. [Sarwer]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why is cosmetic surgery sought out so often?</strong></p>

<p>Patients believe that the only thing which will help them is surgery; hence, they are more likely to seek out a cosmesis professional than a healthcare professional. [Castle]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What sorts of interventions offered in primary care are likely to be coveted by BDD patients? [Hunt]</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Botulinum toxin type A injections</li>
	<li>Collagen and hyaluronic acid “filler’ injections</li>
	<li>Microdermabrasion</li>
</ul>

<p>Be alert to any applicant who seeks out any type of cosmetic intervention at any level of care. This includes breast augmentation.</p>

<p>In many cases, it should be possible to ascertain the extent of the problem for which treatment is being sought. Repeated use of multiple providers in this domain would be a RED FLAG for possible BDD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Do cosmetic interventions generally alleviate BDD?</strong></p>

<p>No…not even if they are “successful.” In many cases, the BDD will actually worsen after the treatments! [Sarwer]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Is there an increased risk of disability in BDD?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, studies have shown a higher prevalence of disability with BDD than in patients with diabetes, major depression or even a recent heart attack! [Phillips, 2000]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How common is suicidality in BDD?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A study by BDD expert Katherine Phillips found that: [Phillips and Menard, 2006]</li>
	<li>58% had suicidal ideation at some time.</li>
	<li>36% (of the whole group; not just the 58%) had ideation related solely to BDD issues.</li>
	<li>2.6% attempted suicide. Including 1.5% (again, of the whole group) solely for BDD reasons.</li>
	<li>The completer rate was 3 per 1000 (0.3%), which suggests that most attempts use less lethal methods.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What are the risk factors for suicidality in BDD patients? [Phillips and Cole]</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Comorbid mood disorders (major depression, bipolar I)</li>
	<li>Comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)</li>
	<li>Any evidence of alcohol of drug abuse</li>
	<li>Greater lifetime impairment due to BDD manifestations</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final observations:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>BDD is a prevalent and significant psychiatric illness which largely goes undiagnosed.</li>
	<li>We are likely to see more “cases” based on incidental mentions in medical histories, as well as when applicants report care for cosmetic issues.</li>
	<li>We should look for clues to BDD in persons with other psychiatric impairments, especially OCD, eating disorders and social anxiety disorder.</li>
	<li>Those with comorbidities are likely to fare worse in terms of recovery.</li>
	<li>Delusional cases would have to considered WORST CASES and any BDD patient treated with antipsychotics on a sustained basis should be inferre to have the delusional form.</li>
	<li>The same conclusion – delusional subtype – should be inferred if the BDD patient is treated as an inpatient on an extended basis.</li>
	<li>The costs of medical care would likely be substantial, especially in those who seek cosmetic interventions.</li>
	<li>The risk of disability would also be significant, depending on individual case context issues.</li>
	<li>It is unlikely that there would be significant extra mortality except in 5 contexts:
	<ul>
		<li>Comorbidity with a psychiatric condition which itself manifests excess mortality…and expect the aggregate impact of both to further raise the risk</li>
		<li>Delusional subtype</li>
		<li>Use of antipsychotics for an extended period of time and/or inpatient care for an extended interval; both of these suggesting the delusional type or major comorbidities.</li>
		<li>History of any significant aspect of suicidality (ideation in recent years; gestures or attempts at any time in the past).</li>
		<li>Any evidence of substance abuse.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
