  <title>Productivity Obsession in Underwriting Management: Report of an Unpublished 2016 Survey </title>
  <link>https://rtaylor193.github.io/insureintell-1col/productivity-obsession-underwriting-management-report-unpublished-2016-survey</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="24618" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Over the last several years, things began to change. Then, within the last 12 months, they became so intolerable that I had to leave” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior Life Underwriter Personal Communication October 2016 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This veteran senior underwriter approached me, seeking to talk about why she left a promising career in a prominent life insurer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I emphasize that this was wholly unsolicited. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being fairly well known within the underwriting community and also because I publish the monthly e-magazine Hot Notes©, it is not unusual for me to be contacted by underwriters. And I put aside whatever I am working on to respond to all questions and concerns raised by my peers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further discussion with the underwriter cited above revealed that the driver of this discontent was a bevy of operational and managerial practice adopted in the wake of a dramatically increased focus on underwriters’ productivity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, it makes sense that every underwriting shop would strive to balance productivity – getting out the work – with the quality of the worked gotten out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, new business executives have been inundated with data addressing all aspects of their operation. These include so-called “productivity metrics,” literally slicing and dicing every aspect of the underwriter’s job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many production metrics have been synthesized by stopwatch timing every step of the risk appraisal process. While this process has had adverse morale implications, it has also generated voluminous data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In at least some companies, these data have led to the imposition of “standards” for APS reading time and other key activities bearing directly on the quality of underwriters’ work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would appear that the mindset of those who have become quite literally obsessed with productivity has its pathogenic roots in a concept dubbed “lean management.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great deal has been written about “lean management” and methods for bringing it to bear in both blue and white collar occupational domains. Indeed, there are many consultancies thirsting for the opportunity to guide firms in their embrace of “lean management” practices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To fully elucidate the potential for adverse outcomes engendered by the unchecked embrace of “lean management “ in our context, we need to consider why companies bother to engage in underwriting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have long recognized that the underwriter’s primary responsibility is to assess risk in a manner consistent with product pricing. By doing so, their efforts directly impact actual-to-expected mortality and thus contribute mightily to bottom line profitability. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might argue that the role of underwriting is even more impactful these days because of razor-thin term pricing, flat sales, high term conversion volumes, increasing antiselection, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, if one sought to literally bring a life insurer to its knees in as little as 3 to 5 years, all one would need to do is pay underwriters solely on the basis of how many cases they approve each day! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have actually been a few insurers that have done – give or take, more or less – what we just described. None of them are still in business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the Christmas break I spoke with a friend who happens to be a veteran underwriter with 30-some years’ experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She told me that her company recently jacked up the % of underwriter performance evaluations that is based solely on case output volume. These evaluations are the main determinant of their compensation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I asked her how this has impacted her work. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I’ve made more mistakes in the last 12 months than I did over the past 30 years...but I get my ‘numbers’ and that’s all they care about.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is it about “getting my numbers” that sounds like something one would expect to hear from a factory worker? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: those who conveniently understate/largely ignore the importance of high quality underwriting in order to maximize productivity are putting their employers’ bottom lines in grave jeopardy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;b&gt;Report of an Unpublished 2016 Survey &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After hearing many comments similar to the one cited at the beginning of this essay, I decided to conduct a brief survey with new business executives who are members of of my three study groups. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invited 24 of them to take this survey. All but one complied. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will now review the most salient questions raised in this survey, looking at how new business executives responded, along with a few of their many timely comments. The questions are in bold italics for easy identification. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;All things considered, which do you think is the more important benchmark for overall underwriter job performance: productivity or quality of decision- making on cases? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;61% chose quality of decision-making, 39% felt they were equally important...and not one elected to answer “productivity.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most eye-opening comment in response to this question: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Considering productivity as equal to quality, when it comes to risk selection, is making a deal with the devil.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Have you either adopted for the first time or changed your underwriter productivity standards in the past 5 years? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;61% said they had done so whereas the other 39% had not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One respondent noted that his company had&lt;em&gt; “...made some adjustments along the way to be less aggressive with productivity.”&lt;/em&gt; Another survey taker added:&lt;em&gt; “we reduced our productivity expectations for 2016.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looks like some new business departments are backing off on previously heightened productivity requirements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One wonders what motivated them to do so. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have your new productivity standards/criteria set higher expectations? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;57% said “yes.”&lt;br /&gt;
The focus here appears to have been on staffing models. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the drivers for one carrier were &lt;i&gt;“technology and workflow improvements.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you set desired/required time limits for the completion of specific underwriting tasks such as reviewing an APS?” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While every survey taker said “yes”, it is noteworthy that 2/3rd chose the response option that added: &lt;i&gt;“...but underwriter performance evaluation is not currently impacted by these criteria and we do not expect to do this in the future.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The comments suggest that average APS review time is primarily used in developing staffing models, and that broader “service level expectations” take precedence over time intervals for specific tasks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From my 40-year perspective, the surest stratagem for putting mortality results in harm’s way is to make slipshod APS reviews in underwriters’ best &lt;i&gt;financial &lt;/i&gt;interests! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Have you had any attrition in your underwriter ranks likely attributable directly or indirectly to your new/revised productivity standards/criteria? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;50% said “yes” and other half said “no”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the only survey question that failed to generate comments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you require underwriters to keep an ongoing record of how they spend increments of their time during the day? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 3 insurers (13%) said “yes.”&lt;br /&gt;
The rest abstain from this tedious practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One added that this was done for the duration of a study (by inference, timing underwriters) and discontinued thereafter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What % of cases reviewed to assess an underwriter’s performance over the course of a year are pending cases (as opposed to those where a final decision was made)? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two frank outliers reported 50% and &gt; 80% respectively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;53% said less than 25% and the remaining 39% do not review any pending cases in this context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is less performance assessment value in reviewing pending cases. Final underwriting actions (approve as applied for, rate or decline) and the reasons underlying them tell us what is most important: the quality of decision making based on all risk-related information at hand. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This said there are also definite quality aspects inherent in how underwriters manage pending cases (especially the “juicy” ones that have been languishing for 30+ days!). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, being in the ± 25% range here likely makes the most sense. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;What % of an underwriter’s final performance assessment/rating is based on quality of case-related decision-making? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I gave respondents 7 options, ranging from &lt; 25% to 75%, and each of these possible answers was selected by at least one survey taker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, 26% chose &lt; 50%, 30% said 50% and 44% indicated that over 50% of their performance assessment was quality-driven. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several respondents added that there were additional components to their audits that did not fall squarely within productivity or underwriting quality parameters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point taken. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably a poorly constructed question. However, it does tell us that the pendulum tilts significantly in favor of quality and 74% of respondents consider productivity not greater than 50% impactful on their performance review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you think that potential savings from increased productivity expectations would likely exceed any increased mortality costs due to underwriting errors incurred by trying to meet higher productivity questions? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the most important survey question bearing on the consequences of productivity obsession. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore it is instructive that 74% do not think that the payoff from heightened productivity demands can even match the inevitable mortality losses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One adroit responder summed up this issue: &lt;i&gt;“there is a point where productivity expectations, if too harsh, would cause errors than would impact mortality.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;If you were considering changes in productivity and related standards, would you seek out forthright input from underwriters before such changes were embraced? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;87% said “yes” without equivocation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whereas 2 chose opted for the caveat that they would not do so: &lt;i&gt;“if they anticipated that such feedback would be highly negative and/or significantly at odds with our goals/intentions.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, inscrutably, one respondent answered “no.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two comments are worth noting: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“Of course! They know the job much better than I do.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“I wish we would but top management would not want this to occur.” &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;When a producer appeals an underwriter’s decision, from whom does that producer learn the results of his appeal? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;87% chose &lt;i&gt;“usually from the underwriter who made the decision being appealed” &lt;/i&gt;while the remaining 13% opted for &lt;i&gt;“always” &lt;/i&gt;from that underwriter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is reassuring that not even one respondent indicated that this sensitive response to a producer would “usually” or “always” come from someone else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this so important? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because nothing undermines an underwriter’s credibility more severely than producers perceiving that management has such little regard for their underwriters that they will override their decisions willy-nilly and do not show them an ounce of respect. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any time an underwriter’s decision is changed – and regardless or whether or not the underwriter agrees with that change – the response to the producer in this setting must come from the underwriter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Self-respecting underwriters would prioritize for seeking out opportunities to leave any insurer that did not adhere to this practice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you think that the net effect of the increasing focus on underwriter productivity in the industry will have an adverse impact on underwriters’ professional status and/or compensation over the next 5 years? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;65% said yes on both counts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The others have put their credibility on the line by maintaining, in the face of common sense and despite the weight of evidence to the contrary, that underwriters will somehow remain unscathed despite unabashed clericalization of their jobs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one is tempted to coin the term “factory-a-zation” in light of what we know about the origins of “lean management” philosophy and its widget-making mentality that drives productivity mania. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To briefly summarize the essence of this essay: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we allow productivity obsession to run roughshod over the quality of underwriting, the only possible outcome is significantly higher actual-to-expected mortality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full impact of this will not come to bear until 3 and 5 years after unfettered embrace of productivity obsession. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By then, many of its architects will have other positions with the company or have moved on to work for other firms. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And their sandbagged successors will be left to clean up this mess. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our hope is that chief underwriters, actuaries, medical directors, C-suite executives and all others genuinely concerned about the success of their company will pause to consider what is at stake here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And do this before we pass the tipping point and it too late to intervene. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the first in a series of commentaries covering a wide range of issues directly or indirectly impacting the future of underwriting and the its professional practitioners. Topics will include the impact of artificial intelligence, a balanced approach to underwriting practices, etc. These commentaries will be announced in Hot Notes© and published at www.insureintell.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Reflections on Non-Underwriters Managing Underwriters</title>
  <link>https://rtaylor193.github.io/insureintell-1col/reflections-non-underwriters-managing-underwriters</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25699" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a widely held notion that one does not have to know the job to manage people who do the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This certainly makes sense for most blue collar and clerical occupations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does the same rationale apply to non-underwriters (defined as individuals that have never been underwriters) managing underwriting professionals?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At our study groups, this is recognized as an increasingly important question, in part because the number of individuals with no underwriting background who oversee new business departments is increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are the areas of potential concern here?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found four broad issues and made some observations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: in each of the following issues posed as questions in bold italics, “they” refers to non-underwriters as heads of underwriting shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do they recognize underwriting as a profession?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find that many are prone to wave off the reality that underwriting is both a science and an art. They see the “art” aspect as a self-serving notion or affection, intended merely to inflate the perception of our value to the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Real underwriting requires the ability to “connect the dots” on a case and then to recognize their interactive implications, both objectively (science) and intuitively (art).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some new underwriters “get it” and others do not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen MBAs “flunk out” as underwriting trainees while others without college degrees became elite risk assessors!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When underwriting is seen as merely tracking down debits in a manual and then using elementary arithmetic to get “the answer,” this reinforces the flawed perception that our profession is little more than a (over-compensated?) clerical occupation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do they value productivity over quality of work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Artificially inflating the significance of productivity while downgrading the comparative significance of the quality of our work is one of the greatest threats to our profession and its future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, it is akin to playing Russian roulette with the insurer’s bottom line!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, I have seen non-underwriters in charge of new business operations embrace productivity as the overarching basis on which they and their subordinates assess underwriters’ performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is far easier to measure productivity than to accurately ascertain the caliber of decision-making. Thus, these individuals are disposed to become enamored of productivity metrics. They favor “stop-watch” studies that measure the time it takes to complete every aspect of our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have you seen any compelling evidence that either mean or median aggregate time measurements have any significance whatsoever in the scheme of things?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I, myself, have not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not to say that productivity is unimportant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An underwriter who typically spends half a day ruminating over a decision on a single case is unlikely to have a long career in our profession! This was as true decades ago as it is today…before we had much in the way of productivity metrics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: productivity is a benchmark best suited to production line workers and routine clerical jobs, where judgment has little or no bearing on work outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality is a benchmark best suited to professional occupations, where judgment has everything to do with work outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The more emphasis placed on productivity at the expense of quality, the closer we come – for want of a better term – to the “clericalization” of the underwriting profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is equally disconcerting when non-underwriter new business executives become naively infatuated with so-called “big data.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are elements here – such as lab scores, financial records, etc. – that have a legitimate place in risk appraisal. Others are anathema to what we do and pose a clear and present danger to our profession and the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already have carefully crafted underwriting paradigms that are cost-effective, highly credible and well accepted by producers, their clients and regulatory authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If new business executives bereft of well-honed underwriting insight unwittingly embrace elements within the “big data” spectrum that undermine our high standards, they put all of us at risk for serious downstream consequences&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are they are less likely to appreciate the importance of continuing education for underwriters and industry networking by underwriters?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-underwriters managing new business operations are more disposed to a “bean counter” mindset than veteran underwriters who run their shops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allocating adequate – indeed, any – budget resources for education and industry networking requires insights and perspectives they often lack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This makes them more prone to currying favor by oft-indiscriminate cost cutting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How highly will continuing education be regarded by those who consider underwriting as essentially productivity driven?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some companies actively support underwriter participation in local and state/provincial underwriting associations; others are more penurious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the most part, veteran underwriters serving as heads of new business appreciate the value of the learning, networking &lt;em&gt;and professional self-esteem&lt;/em&gt;…and therefore support our associations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-underwriter managers are more likely to pinch pennies in this context. I can testify to this because I helped to create or resurrect 6 associations and got far more cooperation from area companies with experienced underwriters in charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are they more likely to choose resource providers based largely if not wholly on cost alone?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many things to consider when choosing a resource provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, one of them is comparative cost for more or less the same product or service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Here are some of the others:&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Comparative turnaround time based on adequate data.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Prevalence of errors, such as poorer quality ECGs.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Subpar performance in other domains that generates complaints from producers and clients.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Abiding by the insurer’s mandates; for example, not sending the lab specimens to the “wrong” lab.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Accessibility and responsiveness when problems or questions arise.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;User-friendliness of their system’s data presentation.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Availability of customized data, such as lab results sliced and diced by various demographics and other criteria.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Peer companies’ experiences with the provider (access to which requires adequate networking).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2014 Reinsurance and Underwriting Services Survey, 57% of respondents rated cost as a “highly significant” consideration when choosing providers. 43% said it was only “somewhat important.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many other considerations got much greater percentages of “highly significant” responses than cost. &lt;em&gt;Could this be a reflection of the divided perspective between underwriters vs. non-underwriter new business executives?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One suspects that non-underwriters managing new business are more likely to make these decisions based largely on cost, with most other factors more or less “off their radar.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are also less disposed to allocate adequate staff to measure provider performance and furthermore they will not have sufficient connectivity to easily seek out the insights from chief underwriters in other companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing Comments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know more than a few instances where non-underwriters have flourished as heads of new business (including several I worked for early in my career).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have done so in large measure because they relentlessly sought out…and then paid close attention to…input from savvy professional underwriter subordinates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This said, I would argue that the weight of evidence favors having a seasoned underwriting professional at the helm of new business operations...especially if one cares, first and foremost, about the company’s mortality bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Underwriters Loyalty To Your Company</title>
  <link>https://rtaylor193.github.io/insureintell-1col/underwriters-loyalty-your-company</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25700" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recently read one of those garden variety diatribes bemoaning the fact that employees do not exhibit the same degree of loyalty to their employers as their predecessors did in the “good old days.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before delving into what insurers can do to remedy this situation (at least where underwriting professionals are concerned), let us first consider the pathogenesis of the less-than-loyal mentality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents lived through the Great Depression (the one in the 1930’s!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parents who survived the Great Depression and later flourished, relatively speaking, within their economic class, sent their offspring a crystal clear message:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Get a good job, work hard at that firm for 40 years, keep your ‘nose clean’…and the company will take care of you.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it any wonder, then, why baby boomers – as they head off into the sunset – are the standard by which employee loyalty is (still) measured?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My kids’ generation saw people like me work long hours (often for free), bring their work home all the time, travel way too much and generally let their job dictate their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They asked “was it really worth it?”…and soon became the first generation to question the way their folks let their jobs run roughshod over their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are steadfast in their belief that lifestyle is more important than anything else (and when we use “lifestyle” in this context, we are not referring simply to wealth accumulation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is about not letting their jobs cut too deeply into their personal lives, living where they want to live geographically, having maximize flexibility in their work schedules and environments, seeing that their employers genuinely supporting their professional development, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly – and I think this is becoming widely appreciated now – hiring ideal candidates as new underwriters and keeping them satisfied will present a much greater challenge going forward than it did in with prior generations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The loyalty insurers covet from their underwriters is a two-way street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to inspire this loyalty in underwriters, you have to take proactive steps to demonstrate that you hold them in the same regard as you want them to hold your company, your shop and you as chief underwriter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are many facets to this such as competitive compensation and benefits, appealing working conditions, flexible working hours, freedom to work from home, business-casual dress code in the office…and a genuine sense of job security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major component is a robust commitment to support their professional development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many small and medium-size insurers are not positioned to hire new underwriter trainees off the street. They replace retirees and others who leave by recruiting fully trained underwriters. This has been more challenging in recent years, in part because we did not develop and mentor underwriters as effectively in the 90’s as compared to prior decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue here is amenability to working from home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know companies that have been stymied when trying to recruit experienced underwriters because they have persisted in mandating that all underwriters must work in the home office. This means many potential candidates would have to relocate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which, in turn, is a common roadblock, in part because many underwriters are in two-income families. Their spouses/partners do not want to give up the jobs they have and/or, given today’s economic climate, worry about finding equivalent opportunities in a new community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most companies that hire new college grads have initial training programs sufficient to assure that these novice underwriters become productive within an acceptable interval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about how many insurers provide for the ongoing professional growth and development (hereafter called PG+D) of experienced underwriters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When underwriters see opportunities for PG+D lavished upon actuaries, IT personnel and others, they expect similar consideration will be extended to them as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of ways in which insurers can provide for underwriters’ PG+D in the company environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allowing underwriters to do more than “just” underwrite is an obvious example. The importance of this was recognized four decades ago when I started my underwriting career and I sense from discussions at study groups, etc., that even more is being done in this regard nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most companies provide monetary support for underwriters who commit to pursuing appropriate credentials. They pay for textbooks and other fees. Many tack on a reward when underwriters earn designations, such as a bonus or a trip to the conference where the designation is formally bestowed. Others are more tight-fisted in this regard (which is hard to fathom considering the modest outlay per person).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The substantial majority of underwriters live within reasonable driving distance of a local or state/provincial underwriting association. Many companies will support their participation in these groups albeit often to an extent that is clearly inadequate (especially when contrasted to the support they give other professionals in the same circumstances).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen too many occasions where companies discourage underwriters to take on leadership roles in local/state associations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they expect underwriters to buy into the notion that employers genuinely care about their PG+D, they should be doing just the opposite. Clearly, speaking from substantial personal experience, I know that these association leadership roles are not so demanding as to impact underwriters’ productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to the knotty problem of continuing to learn and thereby grow their prowess as technical experts in our unique, multidimensional and poly-disciplinary profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In industry surveys, upwards of 90% of chief underwriters say they provide continuing education for underwriters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, when you look past the rhetoric, what you all-too-often find pales by comparison with what should be considered the minimum for underwriter PG+D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many companies cobble together a heterogenous mix of widely spaced in-house presentations or case clinics, a few reinsurer webinars, a subscription to On the Risk and call this hodge-podge their “continuing education program.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is, this simply does not equate to legitimate continuing education akin to what medical directors, actuaries and others have (company-funded) access to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underwriters can see that “cobbled programs” are just a “band aid” approach when it comes to employer commitment to them as professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of insurers participating in our CE program enroll year after year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we ask what the drivers underlie their willingness to do this year-in and year-out, the most prevalent response is that their underwriters look forward to the courses and would be outspokenly disappointed if they did not continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have seen underwriters’ resumes where they cite participation in our CE program as one of their professional achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently spoke with a chief underwriter who had enrolled his underwriters in the past but says he does not intend to do so next year. He said this was because the (staggering) sum of $5000 for 12 courses for his 22 underwriters had now become “beyond budget tolerances.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outlay amounts to $416.66 for one underwriter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is – bizarrely – too steep of a commitment to the PG+D of an underwriting professional, what message does it send?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no new business department budget that cannot “afford” what its takes to make a serious contribution to underwriters’ PG+D.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather, there are chief underwriters who are either ambivalent or refuse to speak up for adequate PG+D resource funding at budget time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, loyalty is a two-way street.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to inspire it in your underwriters, show them you care about their professional growth and development, with a commitment equivalent to that provided for other professionals in the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an unabashed win/win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a huge ROI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
