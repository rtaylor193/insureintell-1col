&lt;p&gt;Alcohol overuse – often but not always identified as “abuse” – and alcohol dependency (alcoholism, a disease) have been insidiously associated with substantial excess mortality – going back to an excellent study by Lincoln National Re in the late 1970s if not before – and well as fulminant excess morbidity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of widespread screening with blood profiles in the mid-1980s, we obtained the results of the gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) test on a vast number of insurance applicants. This test has a well-known and profusely-documented association with heavy drinking. In addition, we also had the results of two other tests associated, albeit less strongly so, with alcohol excess, HDL-C and AST (especially when the AST:ALT ratio is significantly elevated).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ensuing years, two “alcohol markers” were embraced by North American insurers to serve as reflexive tests, ordered when one or more of these screening markers was elevated, as well as in other contexts suspicious for alcohol abuse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them, CDT (carbohydrate-deficient transferrin), is far more widely used by underwriters. It is also used clinically and in other applications outside medical care. The other test, HAA (hemoglobin-associated acetaldehyde), is still used by some, although there are issues about it which have yet to be addressed (in spite of this underwriter’s efforts to get them aired out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As underwriters, we have always yearned for a “magical bullet” which could reliably distinguish excess alcohol intake, free of significant numbers of false-positives and false-negatives. In this way we share a common dilemma with clinical medicine. However, the nature of our needs differs from those of physicians, and some of the assets they deploy in this regard (blood alcohol, diagnostic questionnaires related to heavy drinking, etc.) are either not accessible to us or of little value in our setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, another test has been advanced by some as having value in the risk appraisal process. Known as ethyl glucuronide, or EtG for short, it can apparently be performed on a reliable and affordable basis in underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question which remains to be addressed is whether it brings sufficient value as an underwriting resource to justify the expense and other issues inherent in embracing it in our work. This is the question to be explored in this short paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ethyl Glucuronide Test&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is ethyl glucuronide (EtG)? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a chemical formed when a tiny fraction of alcohol ingested is processed for excretion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most alcohol is processed via the so-called oxidative, or alcohol dehydrogenase, pathway. The remaining 5% is either excreted unchanged in the urine and sweat, or via exhalation; or metabolized by a non-oxidative pathway. It is this latter pathway which results in the presence of EtG in urine, blood and other mediums where its presence can be measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a marker for recent alcohol intake, EtG is far superior to blood or urine alcohol levels because it has a much longer elimination period. Thus, a positive EtG test provides significant evidence of recent alcohol consumption even when alcohol is no longer present in the body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What method is used to measure EtG? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Dr. Pamela Bean, an expert in this field, the test is best done on urine using an enzyme immunoassay which, when positive, is confirmed using liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (a confirmation technique similar to what we use for drugs of abuse).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long after last use can alcohol intake be detected using EtG? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the literature on EtG, we find a number of differing answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a cohort of alcoholics in detoxification, Beck et al. were able to detect EtG in urine for 65 hours after last apparent intake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skipper et al., in Alabama, report “an extended window for assessment of drinking status (up to 5 days)” with EtG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How soon after alcohol intake can EtG be detected in urine? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dahl and his Swedish coworkers found detectable EtG one hour after consumption of one beer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At what daily level of alcohol intake is EtG positive in healthy people? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a cohort of healthy volunteers, Borucki and his colleagues reported a positive EtG level in healthy subjects free of known alcohol abuse who consumed an average of 36 grams of alcohol per day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In males, 36 g/day is less than half of the threshold most widely-recognized as defining “abuse” (80 or more g/day).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How soon after alcohol take have researchers found false-negative EtG readings? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a commercial EtG assay, Wojcik and Hawthorne had negative ETG results on all subjects at &gt; 26 hours after drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helander et al. reported EtG false-negatives as early as 24 hours. After 5 days of storage, urine EtG was only detectable in 50% that were positive on day one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can heavy water intake prior to collecting a urine sample for EtG testing cause a false-negative? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. [Dahl]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are there any causes of false-positive EtG tests that could be significant in an underwriting context?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, and quite a number of them, actually:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gargling with mouthwash containing 12% ethanol [Costantino]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Cough syrup [Wurst]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Purell hand sanitizers [Bean]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Food products containing cooking wines and vanilla extracts [Bean]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The over-the-counter remedies sold as NyQuil® and Vicks® [Bean]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Several beauty products [Bean]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Urinary tract infection due to E. coli [Bean]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any other factors that can distort the results of EtG tests? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes: [Wurst and Wiesbeck]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Marijuana use&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chronic kidney disease&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Elevated creatinine independent of a diagnosis of CKD&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the main perceived value of EtG? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…if the question of recent alcohol consumption is to be answered in a dichotomous way (yes/no), like for the question of lapses or in persons who have committed to abstinence (e.g., physician health care programs), the cumulative data support the use of the test for EtG in urine.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friedrich Martin Wurst, et al.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
28(2004):1220&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, EtG can, save for a few false-negatives, rule out recent drinking within some window period of detection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What use is postulated for EtG in a clinical context? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We use this test all the time. It is the best test we have for measuring recent use. When patients leave our facility for a few days, when they come back, we obtain an EtG…” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul H. Earley, MD (as cited by Bob&lt;br /&gt;
Littell, based on an interview)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Broker World &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
November, 2007:40&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…it is possible to refute a claimed alcohol abstinence by a positive EtG in blood, urine, skin, swab or hair – with a reliability greater than was provided previously by ethanol.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stephen Seidl et al.&lt;br /&gt;
Institute of Legal Medicine&lt;br /&gt;
University of Erlangen, Germany&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Addiction Biology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
6(2001):205&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wurst and Skipper identify the following settings in which they believe EtG would have value:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Alcohol treatment programs&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Safety-sensitive work settings&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Other settings where alcohol use may be risky (pregnancy, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Forensic assessments&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any way to enhance EtG testing? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, by adding a second, closely-related test known as ethyl sulfate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This enhances the alcohol intake detection capacity of EtG but does not extend its window of detection beyond – at best – 5 days, often less. [Bean]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helander et al. have recently concluded that “&lt;em&gt;…EtS&lt;/em&gt; [ethyl sulfate]&lt;em&gt; testing should accompany, be used to verify, or in the future possibly replace EtG testing.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prospects for Ethyl Glucuronide Testing in an Underwriting Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What cutoff has been proposed for EtG testing in underwriting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“…somewhere in the 0.5 mg/L range.” [private communication from an industry provider]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does this present any problems? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it would mean positives due to the aforementioned causes of false-positives and could also lead to distorted results based on elevated creatinine and marijuana use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The extent of these interferences has yet, as regards most of them, to be fully ascertained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How might EtG be deployed if it were used in underwriting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that one might perform EtG based on elevated liver enzymes. Then, if EtG is positive, further reflex to CDT or possibly HAA. This is held to be a way of minimizing excessive spending on the more costly CDT and HAA tests. [private communication from an industry provider]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could we screen with EtG? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, that makes no sense given its modest window of detection and the fact that all we can say of any person who tests positive is that they consumed some quantity of alcohol within that interval. Consuming alcohol, per se, means nothing in our context…unlike the above-mentioned clinical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should we consider reflexing in the above-mentioned manner, based on an “elevated liver enzyme”? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not if that enzyme is ALT, or AST when it is not more than two times higher than ALT, and in the absence of another probable cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, when one examines the reasons for which insurers say they now order CDT and/or HAA reflexive testing, a number make little or no sense to this underwriter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If GGT is elevated and EtG is negative, what do we know? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming the EtG is not a false-negative, all we know is that someone who may nevertheless be a heavy drinker (especially a binge drinker, with perhaps the greatest short-term excess mortality of any mode of overuse) has likely not consumed alcohol for a period of not longer than 5 days and quite possibly less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the use of EtG in the context of isolated elevated GGT raise any other issues regarding how we assess an elevated GGT reading? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes…and this is of particular concern because we have yet to recognize, as an industry, the overwhelming association between elevated GGT and the risk of CV disease. We have covered this in our CE course on GGT and it would be refreshing for those who set underwriting criteria to factor this important information into their guidelines for assessing GGT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do the causes of false-positives due to factors unrelated to beverage alcohol intake have implications for us in underwriting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would mean that many persons with GGT elevated due to non-alcohol-related reasons plus EtG elevated due to mouthwash, etc. would require “double-reflexing” (GGT to EtG to CDT).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore (as we have reported many times), there is very modest overlap between GGT and CDT in terms of pinpointing heavy drinking. Thus, if GGT is elevated and ETG is also elevated, it is still more likely that CDT will yield more false-negatives than true-positives in this setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there any other consideration which must be borne in mind if we consider using EtG in underwriting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Helander et al. have pointed out, EtG testing has already led to “adverse publicity” because it elevates from unintentional alcohol intake due to mouthwash use, hand sanitizers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of existing concerns about this test in non-underwriting contexts, its deployment in underwriting could lead to challenges from some quarters in ways not associated with other prospective new testing alternatives (which likely represent a better use of our budget dollars).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In consideration of the foregoing, do you believe we should deploy EtG testing in underwriting at this time? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Then how do we deal with screening test results suspicious for alcohol abuse? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By relying less on reflexive testing and more on (real) underwriting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means seeing the elevated GGT (or whatever) in the CONTEXT of the whole case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the findings in the 2007 Underwriting Requirements Survey, as well as audits we have done, we conclude that 50% or more of alcohol-related reflexive testing currently done is not only unnecessary per se…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…but also culminates in underwriting decisions inferior to those that would have been made if we had devoted more time to assessing the whole risk in CONTEXT…and then making the best possible offer on that basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
