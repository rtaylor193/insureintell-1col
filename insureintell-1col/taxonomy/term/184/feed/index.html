  <title>A History Lesson in Insurance Screening</title>
  <link>https://rtaylor193.github.io/insureintell-1col/node/25650</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25650" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is said that those who do not know history are doomed to repeat it. In the spirit of this truism, a specter looming in underwriting is in dire need of sobering historical perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time, a cancer marker that showed initial promise was embraced for use in insurance screening by a prominent carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not for long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fallout was as diffuse as it was intense, coming from the media, the clinical community and consumer advocates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this writing, a modicum of momentum has been stirred for the use of another cancer marker. this one—dubbed CEA for carcinoembryonic antigen—is neither new nor untested. indeed, it has been used routinely for decades in meticulously specific contexts related to already-diagnosed colon carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the other cancer marker in current use, prostate specific antigen (PSA), CEA is never used to screen for malignancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might one fashion a case for using CEA in insurance screening? Absolutely, provided one is content to focus only on alleged protective value in a vacuum, akin to seeing the proverbial tree in lieu of the forest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a case has now been carefully crafted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understand that arguments could be made for dozens of screening tests. Fact is, an airtight one, devoid of downstream consequences, exists for a cardiovascular test known as Nt-proBNp. Other candidates hover as well, awaiting due diligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we can use Nt-proBNp, why not CEA as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us count the reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEA is not approved, and never will be, as a screening test. PSA is a sanctioned screening test. Nt-proBNP is all but assured the same destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An abnormal Nt-proBNP test tells us there is likely some abnormality in cardiac function, most of which confer some excess mortality. This said, such conditions also will be manageable clinically, and interventions in at least some will enhance longevity prospects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEA, at the threshold advocated to demarcate a positive test, means that if cancer is present, the prognosis is likely far more ominous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Isn’t this an argument for using CEA?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. it’s a siren song.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority who are pinpointed by means of an abnormal CEA test will be told, after enormous personal angst and considerable (given health insurance these days) out-of-pocket expense, that they are cancer-free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such relief quickly turns to frustration, then to anger, egged on by the attending physician, who will say to this patient: “Frankly, I can’t understand why they would bring grief down upon your head by using this test in such an irresponsible manner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only ears to which this damning statement plays as music decorate the heads of a well-described subspecies of attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folks, this isn’t a hypothetical consequence of CEA screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a certain one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decide now whether to proceed down this treacherous path in the certain knowledge there are other, smarter, safer alternatives for screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apprehend history or reanimate nightmares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Underwriting Serum Ferritin</title>
  <link>https://rtaylor193.github.io/insureintell-1col/node/25658</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25658" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is this subject important? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“A high serum ferritin level may serve as a surrogate marker for poor health.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond Gambino, MD&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;LAB REPORT &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
17(1995):91&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can say the same for an abnormally low serum ferritin, especially in males over 50 and post-menopausal females, doubly so if they are known to have microcytic/Fe-deficiency anemia or GI symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is ferritin? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An iron-binding protein.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the “normal range” for ferritin? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is some variance between laboratories (as is true with so many tests). That said, the normal ranges cited by Wallach in his widely used lab handbook are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border="1" width="344"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td width="137"&gt;
			&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age Grouping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td width="191"&gt;
			&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal Range ng/mL or mcg/L &lt;/strong&gt;(µmol/L)&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;6 mos-15 years&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;7-142 (16-320)&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Adult male&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;20-300([45-675)&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;Adult female&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;15-120 (34-270)&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others set ranges between 13-60 (29-135) on the low end, and 123-651 (277-1465) on the high end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must know the normal range of any ostensibly abnormal ferritin result reported in medical records before you can use it in risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you show ferritin values in nanograms per milliliter, micrograms per liter, and micro-moles per liter? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because ng/mL is the measurement used in the USA and the two are measurements used elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hereafter we will show ng/mL, but you can easily convert to µmol/L by multiplying the ng/mL reading x 0.445.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does menopause affect ferritin? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one study of bodily iron stores in healthy postmenopausal US females, 3% had very low readings (&lt; 12) and 10% had readings &gt; 200. [Liu]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would you expect the same pattern in premenopausal women? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No…because of the prevalence of significant menstrual blood loss, we would expect, if anything, the reverse, with low readings much more common than high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When is ferritin testing done clinically? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not, as you know, a routine part of blood profile testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main clinical uses of ferritin testing would be:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Determine presence and extent of Fe (iron) overload in known/suspected primary (hereditary) or secondary iron overload disorders.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Predict and monitor degree of iron deficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Determine response to Fe therapy or compliance with treatment.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Differentiate Fe deficiency from other types of microcytic (low MCV) anemia.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Monitor iron status in patients with chronic kidney disease, hemochromatosis, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;As you can see, the range of uses predicts that we will often see ferritin reported in medical records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the first question to ask when you see ferritin reported? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why it was done…NOT whether or not it is normal (that’s the second question).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How common is elevated serum ferritin in the general North American population (without regard to the presence vs. absence of disease)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6% overall. [Adams]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is transferrin saturation (TS)? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another measure of iron overload, more sensitive but less specific than ferritin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How common is ferritin elevation in persons with TS elevation, again in the absence of known disease? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9% in males under 45 and 13% in females under 35, increasing to as much as 22% in males over 62 and 21% in females over 62. [Looker]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is very high ferritin common overall among persons hospitalized, without regard to the reason? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes – 7% in one study [Lee, M. H.], which supports the opening observation by lab guru Raymond Gambino.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does ferritin increase in persons with a higher likelihood of disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it functions as an acute phase reactant…that is, a marker for inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does inflammation affect TS in the same way? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it tends to lower TS, which is one reason why elevated ferritin in the presence of a normal or low TS reading is a clue to a cause other than iron overload. [Looker]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does ferritin vary day-to-day in otherwise healthy people? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, by as much as 15%, according to another lab guru named Ravel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What factors interfere with ferritin reading validity? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Recent transfusion or, possibly, donating blood.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Recent ingestion of a meal with high iron content.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hemolytic disease may cause an artificially high reading.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Menstruation may cause a lower-than-normal reading.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pregnancy, also lowering the reading.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use of iron supplementation therapy.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Minimal elevation possible when taking oral contraceptives.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Low ferritin with daily aspirin use, even at one-a-day level intake. [Haidari]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No other commonly taken drugs are known to be associated with elevated readings according to the American Association for Clinical Chemistry’s reference book on Rx effects on lab tests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which lab tests are associated with elevated or below-normal ferritin? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;GGT – elevated ferritin is associated with elevated GGT, especially when heavy drinking is suspected and even in the absence of any known liver disease. [Kristenson]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ALT and AST – but likely only in the presence of known or occult liver damage or clinically-silent hemochromatosis. [AACC reference book]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Four pituitary hormones can exert a lowering effect: growth, follicle-stimulating, luteinizing and gonadotrophic – for what it is worth. [AACC reference book]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;A few studies have shown higher levels in persons with elevated cholesterol or triglycerides. [AACC reference book]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does temperate alcohol intake affect ferritin? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one study “down under,” they found this in otherwise healthy people [Rossi]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table border="1" width="384"&gt;
	&lt;tbody&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td rowspan="2" width="147"&gt;
			&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alcohol Intake/Day (grams/day)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td colspan="2"&gt;
			&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mean Ferritin Reading (ng/mL/mcg/L) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td width="106"&gt;
			&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Males&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td width="109"&gt;
			&lt;div align="center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Females &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;1-10 (≤ 1 drink)&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
			&lt;div align="center"&gt;71&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
			&lt;div align="center"&gt;26&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;11-50 (1-4 drinks)&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
			&lt;div align="center"&gt;85&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
			&lt;div align="center"&gt;32&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
		&lt;tr&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;&gt;50 (4+ drinks)&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
			&lt;div align="center"&gt;104&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
			&lt;td&gt;
			&lt;div align="center"&gt;72&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;/td&gt;
		&lt;/tr&gt;
	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liu found similar results in postmenopausal females…ferritin increased but within the normal range at levels of 2-3/drinks per day (which is the upper level of “social drinking” stipulated for in women &lt; 65 years old by most experts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, yes, temperate drinking (even as defined in my home state!) does increase ferritin, but not to any significant extent as far as we are concerned (that is, with the caveat that they did not segregate readings in persons consuming much higher levels!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hyperferritinemia (Elevated Serum Ferritin)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is alcohol liver disease associated with high ferritin? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does heavy intake of red meat increase ferritin levels? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely…but it would take a pretty devout carnivore to reach levels suggestive of undiagnosed disease! [Rossi]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other factors may significantly raise ferritin? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One US study showed a higher incidence of elevations in obese persons and cigarette smokers…but the evidence for this does not appear sufficient in well persons to justify much concern in our view. [Kato]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do highly trained athletes have higher ferritin levels than other people of the same age? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, it would seem they do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lippi found that professional competition cyclists had mean levels of 332 ng/mL as compared to 127 ng/mL in amateur cyclists, and concluded that “professional endurance athletes have serum ferritin concentrations that are 2-fold to 3-fold higher than those matched sedentary individuals and amateur athletes.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do we have any clue as to why this is true? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes…Zotter showed that professional road cyclists use “excessive iron supplementation” – which is one form of blood doping designed to confer competitive advantage!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they should start monitoring ferritin in professional athletes?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just kidding…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the main pathological factors associated with elevated serum ferritin in the general population? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zelber-Sagi found that both nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hyperinsulinemia (a prediabetic condition) were associated with high readings in a large unselected sample of the general population (in a country, we might add, where hereditary hemochromatosis is not very common!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the presence of elevated ferritin in NAFLD correlate with an increased risk of NASH – that is, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the most significant type of NAFLD? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes…and also with an increased risk of advanced fibrosis in patients with NASH. [Trombini, Zelber-Sagi]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, elevated ferritin would be an adverse finding in NASH or un-biopsied NAFLD (which could be NASH), from an underwriting perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the same true in chronic hepatitis C? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iron overload is significantly more common in chronic HCV than in the general population and elevated ferritin levels are found in 20-35% of patients. That said, recent studies now question at least five earlier ones that linked high ferritin to fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, Guyader and her French colleagues found that ferritin was not fibrogenic (associated with inducing fibrosis) but that is was a valid surrogate marker for greater disease severity overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is high ferritin associated with known hyperglycemia? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fumeron et al. studied 1,277 patients sorted by the presence (vs. absence) of hyperglycemia. They found that impaired fasting glucose (IFG) is associated with significantly increased readings, as compared to normoglycemic subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this does not mean that most IFG cases will have elevated readings; rather, it only means that the average readings are greater when fasting glucose is above normal but not high enough to be considered IFG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also wholly consistent with the earlier observation regarding the link between hyperinsulinemia and higher ferritin levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the same true for diabetics? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likely if they are obese Type 2 diabetics who have NAFLD (a very common scenario, one might add).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also in those few cases where (typically sudden onset, symptomatic) diabetes at age 45 or over is deemed to be due to hemochromatosis – with the iron overload accompanying hemochromatosis being the likely cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Canturk and associates found that poor control in DM was particularly likely to correlate with elevated ferritin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hughes reported that mean serum ferritin was also much higher in Chinese, Malay, Indian-Asian and Korean diabetics than in nondiabetics of the same ethnic origins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the best clue to NAFLD in obese diabetics? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Elevated ALT, with elevated AST in some cases if the ALT-to-AST ratio is ≤1, and there is no evidence of any other prevalent cause of ALT elevation such as chronic hepatitis C (also more common in diabetics, to muddy the waters!), chronic hepatitis B, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does ferritin tend to be higher in the metabolic syndrome than in those free of this prevalent and insidious disorder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure…but remember that chronic hyperglycemia and NAFLD are also quite prevalent in this syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one study, the strongest link between elevated ferritin and metabolic syndrome was in those with hypertriglyceridemia (one of 5 criteria for the syndrome). [Vari]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trombini found that the incidence of hyperferritinemia increased as the number of metabolic syndrome criteria increased in any given patient.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is ferritin associated with cardiovascular disease? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Strong epidemiological evidence is available that iron is an important factor in the process of atherosclerosis.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B. de Valk, MD and J. J. Marx, MD&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Archives of Internal Medicine &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
159(1999):1542&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is high ferritin associated with CAD? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes [You] and mostly at ages 50 and under as opposed to 60+. [Aronow, Haidari]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has anyone shown that elevated ferritin is linked to a greater degree of ischemia-related heart impairment? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say et al. found that hypercholesterolemic patients showed a significant correlation between magnitude of serum ferritin and probability of impaired perfusion, wall motion abnormalities and irreversible defects on imaging and angiographic studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haidari in Iran found that males with angiographically-proven CAD had higher average ferritin readings than men who did not have disease…but the mean levels were well within the normal range for ferritin. Women, on the other hand, showed no evidence of an impact of ferritin in this context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is high ferritin linked to an increased risk of MI? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two studies showed a definite, if modest, link between ferritin and MI. This was more pronounced if there were other CAD-risk comorbidities present. [Klipstein-Grobusch, Tuomainen]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is ferritin linked to excess CV mortality? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sempos reviewed 16 studies and found that 88% of them did not show a significantly increased risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, van der A did establish that the highest tertile (top 3rd) of ferritin readings correlated with a 2-fold increased risk of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the bottom line where ferritin and CV disease is concerned? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While ferritin likely plays a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic disease, it does not appear to be enough of a risk factor for us to consider in CV risk triage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, we would argue that more than moderately-elevated ferritin – especially when the cause has not been found and addressed – is definitely incompatible with preferred risk!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is elevated ferritin linked to cancer? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the celebrated Framingham Offspring Cohort, elevated serum iron – which undoubtedly will be associated with elevated ferritin as well in many cases – was clearly a risk factor for cancer, doubly so when HDL-C was &lt; 41. [Mainous]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neoplastic disease is commonly cited in lab manuals as one of the chief causes of hyperferritinemia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should we be particularly concerned when the ferritin is mega-elevated (as in &gt; 1000 ng/mL or &gt; 2250 µmol/L)? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Our findings suggest that serum ferritin extreme elevations&lt;/em&gt; [they used &gt; 1000]&lt;em&gt;, taken by themselves, are a non-specific indicator of significant disease…” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark H. Lee, MD, et al.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The American Journal of Medicine &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
98(1995):566&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, YES…it would not be incumbent upon us to offer insurance coverage in this context until a satisfactory workup was done to determine the cause of such a major elevation…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and if no cause were established and dealt with (which is not an uncommon outcome), we would still be steadfast in postponing consideration because some life-threatening diseases may be below the threshold of discovery early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other factors would make us doubly reluctant to consider mega-elevations? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Age 65+&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Recent weight loss ≥ 10% of pre-loss weight, especially if not credibly explained (as nicely documented by Hearnshaw)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Heavy, longtime cigarette smoking (as in pack years, not merely current use!)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Very low or falling cholesterol (in the absence of hypolipidemic Rx)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Low serum albumin&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Elevated GGT&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the main causes of such mega-elevations?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Neoplastic disease&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Alcoholic liver disease; other chronic and advanced liver pathologies&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Hematological diseases&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chronic inflammatory diseases which are clinically active (symptomatic)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Autoimmune diseases&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Advanced renal disease&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Symptomatic disease associated with HIV-1 infection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypoferritinemia (Ferritin Readings Below Normal)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the main causes of low serum ferritin? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;#1 is Fe deficiency anemia&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Chronic blood loss, usually with anemia present&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Disturbed iron absorption, which occurs in Crohn disease, more significant cases of celiac disease and other acute/chronic enteropathies (small bowel disorders)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Pregnancy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is considered to be a low ferritin in someone with depleted iron stores due to known or suspected Fe deficiency? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt; 22 ng/mL. [Joosten]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the reading gets down to &lt; 12 ng/mL most experts concur that this is sufficient to make a diagnosis of iron deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can asymptomatic hypoferritinemia be associated with serious disease? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one important study, 5 of 64 asymptomatic older age patients with ferritin &lt; 50 ng/mL who had diagnostic colonoscopy were found to have occult colon cancer and 2 more in the same cohort had large premalignant adenomatous colon polyps. [John Lee]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among those with low ferritin who had upper GI endoscopy (132 patients) – whether symptomatic or not for undiagnosed illness – there were 2 cancers, 15 cases of advanced esophagitis and 31 patients with ulcers or erosions in either the stomach or the duodenum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joosten performed upper and lower GI studies on 151 older-age individuals with low ferritin (in this case, &lt; 22 ng/mL or &lt; 50 µmol/L) and found 18 colon cancers, 5 of which were not associated with overt anemia (low hemoglobin).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lipato reported a 9.2% incidence of colon cancer in 414 subjects, mostly male and mean age 70, whose ferritin was &lt; 50 ng/mL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the correlation between low ferritin and hemoglobin levels? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J.G. Lee reported that patients with very low (≤ 20 ng/mL) ferritin had a mean Hb (hemoglobin) of 11.1 g/dL, while those between 21 and 50 had an average Hb reading of 12.7.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, mild – rather than moderate-to-severe anemia – is the rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did these patients also have low MCV readings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those with very low ferritin did; less so with readings in the 21-50 range…which means that ferritin is often an earlier indicator of risk than the presence of microcytosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the colon cancer risk increased if ferritin is &gt; 100 ng/mL? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No…but the authors who reported this also maintained that older patients with readings &lt; 100 “may benefit” from colonscopy. [Sawhney]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the bottom line on low ferritin? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In Crohn disease or celiac disease, it portends a less favorable risk status.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In younger persons (premenopausal females; males under ago 50) it probably doesn’t confer much added risk; that is, unless there are uninvestigated symptoms or other risk factors (polyp-forming syndromes, for example).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;At older ages, and progressively so at 65 and over, applicants with very low readings are – in our opinion – uninsurable, and we would maintain a high index of suspicion even between 21-50 ng/mL or 47-113 µmol/L depending on other case context factors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should we use ferritin as a screening test? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall…never.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, one could fashion an argument for doing so at ages 65 and over based on all of the foregoing. Indeed, it would not surprise this underwriter if the protective value of screening with serum ferritin was higher than many of the things we do now at ages 65+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, as it is not a tumor marker, we wouldn’t have the problems that make tests like CEA and its kindred the potential nightmares for insurers that abundant experience has shown them to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note to Readers &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This paper on underwriting ferritin tests contains material originally intended to be included in our CE course on HEMOCHROMATOSIS…but that course turned out to be long enough, so we saved it for this project. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The format of this course is similar to our CE and IE courses, giving you a good idea of what CE, in particular, is like. We hope you find it appealing in format, style and nature of content! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Why CI? : The Potential of Critical Illness Coverage</title>
  <link>https://rtaylor193.github.io/insureintell-1col/node/25682</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25682" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would like to be able to recount to you how a beautiful lady, in a streaming white gown, floated over this underwriter’s bed one evening and said, “build it and they will come” (or something to that effect).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alas, it was words of inspiration from eminent consulting actuary Jack Bragg in an essay in The National Underwriter (September, 2000) that jumpstarted my awareness of the incredible and — as yet overwhelmingly untapped — potential of critical illness (CI) insurance in our marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You were so right, Jack, when you opined that CI is “. . .the only coverage that can replace future potential economic assets that have been destroyed by major catastrophic health events while the insured remains alive.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why then, three years later, is this unquestionable “fourth leg” (with life, disability, and LTC, that is) of any properly protected policyowner’s portfolio still in relative limbo, offered by a mere handful of enterprising domestic carriers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The producers say they are waiting for insurers to manufacture CI; the insurers contend they are waiting for the producers to demand CI; and meanwhile we are treated largely to silence while compelling opportunity paradoxically eludes a marketplace so incredibly primed for something new. (Not to mention something more customer-comprehensible than variable universal life or long-term care insurance!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical illness insurance — sometimes referred to as dread disease insurance — is exactly what its name implies: a form of coverage which pays a living benefit when the policyholder contracts one of the impairments named in the contract. These conditions typically include heart attack, stroke, invasive (thus, potentially life-threatening) cancer, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical illness owes its roots to the South African insurance industry, where Dr. Marius Barnard created the first versions of what was destined to become a big seller in many of the world’s leading and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be shown that CI is a market factor almost everywhere, from South Africa and the United Kingdom, to Australia and, increasingly, Asia Pacific. It has a solid foothold north of our border and is making steady headway in some Latin American markets as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, efforts to promote wider embrace of this natural asset in the United States have thus far, for the most part, met with indifference and perturbing corporate lassitude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus of this underwriter’s work, primarily in the medical risk management domain, has me seeing CI from the perspective of the patient, saddled with a sobering reality: that the hospital to which he has been triaged by his health care plan for an upcoming coronary angioplasty may not, in fact, be his venue of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, if “choice” were a consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact is, a study published in July 2002 in the American Heart Association’s prestigious Journal of the American College of Cardiology revealed disconcertingly wide hospital-to-hospital differences in post-angioplasty mortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would you prefer to be intervened upon in an institution where there are virtually no unfortunate short-term outcomes . . .or one with a far less inspiring track record?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without CI coverage, this is not likely to be a matter of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a self-employed small-businessman in my mid-50s, my biggest immediate concern is not life insurance but rather critical illness coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How compatible, for example, would a three-month stroke-mediated hiatus be with my consuming agenda to grow my nascent enterprise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What effects might the loss of much-needed interval revenues have on my prospects for resuming where I left off . . . after six months of inactivity imposed by multimodal cancer therapy?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Point taken?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endeavoring to present the merits of critical illness insurance in a balanced light, I availed myself of learned input from two individuals well known to me in the U.S. reinsurance community, both of them quite active in this domain for some years now. They are Tony Forte (Vice President, GeneralCologne Re in Connecticut) and Susan Kimball, FSA, MAAA (Marketing VP of Living Benefits, ING Re, Denver).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I asked Susan why she thought CI would be a slamdunk sale for so many prospects, she pointed to the fact that typically two thirds of the aggregate cost of combating a bout with curable cancer is often not paid by conventional health insurance arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an imposing observation when one considers the prevalence of this disease in our society and the fact that 2 in 3 patients are cured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tony believes that it is CI’s versatility that beckons. After all, CI is a good fit in almost every market niche, from the high end to employee-benefits to worksite. CI has enormous appeal to the middle market as well and is an inspired element in bancassurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Susan adds to this point that CI is also something of a magic bullet, as it were, where mortgage insurance is concerned. Consider that nearly half of all foreclosures are driven by critical illnesses, while barely 3 percent are attributable to death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the truth were told, it is the careful choice of language mandated in the critical illness policy that piques our interest as underwriters. The task of defining what is — and what isn’t — a “heart attack,” which involves melding evolving clinical concepts with what is both practical and feasible in an insurance context, is the kind of challenge that inspires us (and is also quite essential to proper product design).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Tony articulated in his response to my delving into CI recently, there are no fewer than five important issues to tend to in a successful CI product launch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Honing the contractual language (as just referenced)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Tailoring your product to your target market&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Setting up capable underwriting and claims resources to support this unique offering&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Providing for marketing and producer training&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Committing to properly managing and thus successfully growing this line of business&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired insurers that make this commitment will acquire pole positions in their respective markets. So convinced are we — the Susans, Tonys, and Hanks — of CI’s vast potential that we have already conspired to take numerous initiatives to push the efforts over the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two consecutive and very well-attended Society of Actuaries’ (SOA’s) seminars on CI inspired the SOA to team up with LOMA and LIMRA to host an upcoming Critical Illness Symposium, set to convene September 18 and 19 in New Orleans. Under Susan’s general chairpersonship this first-ever domestic two-track CI conference is certain to draw a large audience and thus further fuel CI awareness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last January, visionary Canadian producer Alphonso Franco (Trenton Financial) orchestrated The World Critical Illness Conference in Vancouver. Dr. Marius Barnard, backed up by a strong marketing-oriented multidisciplinary program, treated some 500 delegates from around the world to an inspiring message on the potential for CI insurance here in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alphonso is already hard at work planning an encore congress this coming January in lovely Victoria, British Columbia. The hope is that an increasing number of Americans will make the trip after having attended the SOA/LOMA/LIMRA Symposium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These and many other initiatives will focus a well-deserved spotlight on what critical illness insurance can offer us all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The opportunities here are crystal clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Why CII</title>
  <link>https://rtaylor193.github.io/insureintell-1col/node/25689</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25689" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off, my apologies for not doing a second teleunderwriting essay as promised in June. I decided critical illness insurance (CII) just should not wait. So look for teleunderwriting part two next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just two days before being inspired to pen this overdue essay, this underwriter was addressing an audience of peers on 26th and Madison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How many of you know what critical illness insurance is?” A scattering of hands, slowly ascending, as if to say,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Well, maybe…a little.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next question, “What would you say if I told you it was destined for stardom? To be America’s next big insurance product?” A wall of silence, less disconcerting only for the generalized non-defensive body language! Like I said, this essay is just a bit overdue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s say you’re advised by your physician to have a coronary angioplasty. No emergency—not yet, anyway—but the time has come to widen the old lumen, to turn a phrase. Would just any hospital suffice, as it might for, say, a hemorrhoidectomy? Or, would you be more selective, given the organ involved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What if you’d just read a paper in a prominent cardiology journal documenting wide hospital-to-hospital variation in mortality associated with angioplasty procedures? As in zero percent mortality in hospital A versus 9.1 percent in hospital B!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or, what if your last esophagoscopy (ugh) for a Barrett turned up early — and apparently resectable—adenocarcinoma? Would you prefer hospital A (with four percent surgical mortality in this procedure) or hospital B (with one death in every 6.5 patients having said surgery)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about it…which hospital would you choose with your life on the line? The operative word, of course, is “choose.” To “choose” in this context means having the bucks to make the call…and avoid being involuntarily sent (triaged? sentenced? damned?) to hospital B.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For most of us, the necessary dollars to make an informed choice will only be available if we have critical illness insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then there are those experimental therapies; you know, the ones that sometimes cure the “incurable” (I know a wonderful lady and beloved friend who had stage IV ovarian cancer 11 years ago, which just happens to be about four times one’s life expectancy with this disease; it does happen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the record, experimental therapies usually have three things in common: they require travel (with an extended stay away from home), they are quite costly, and (need we say) they are rarely if ever covered by garden-variety health insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, critical illness insurance to the rescue…and we haven’t even begun to talk about those other expenses which inevitably accrue from critical illness and unmask previously unappreciated shortcomings in your DI coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outlast your dread disease (eight of ten survive life-threatening illness), then wish you hadn’t…when you see the financial mess! Not exactly The American Dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now ask again why I say that critical illness insurance is a hand in glove fit in most clients’ portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a refreshing experience for the broker: no complex formulas to understand and explain. When you think about it, CI is probably the least complex insurance product, for the customer anyway, this side of mortgage term!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It covers precisely those conditions—cancer, heart attack, stroke—for which we are at greatest risk of experiencing catastrophic illness. True, most carriers are browbeaten by marketing to embellish their product with another dozen (in one case, they tell me, over 100) additional covered dread diseases and critical life events. However, the big three are the ones that really matter to most clients. (Let the record show that this underwriter has a hard time visualizing how multiple sclerosis fits within the common sense risk boundaries of critical illness!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Critical illness insurance:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fills a clear, present, and easily visualized void in anyone’s otherwise picture-perfect portfolio. As in, funding the choice to live, not die!&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Fits every distribution mode, from worksite on up.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Has inherent appeal to blue collar customers.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Might pave our way back to our long-neglected middle market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will CI become our most coveted twenty-first century employee benefit? Will cutting-edge employers use it to lure top talent? And what of those who fall through the cracks in conventional DI, such as over-the-road truckers? Is critical illness insurance not ideal for them? The risk aspect of critical illness insurance offers a novel challenge to bored underwriters, if only because the contract defines the risk!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is and what isn’t cancer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one’s troponin T is elevated, does that make the event a myocardial infarction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes a true stroke from a “mere” reversible ischemic neurologic deficit (a category between a TIA and a true stroke)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call me crazy (others have), but—golly—I just love this stuff! Having already chaired the faculty for two (sell-out) Society of Actuaries’ seminars on critical illness insurance, and having contributed a paper to a four-article series in &lt;em&gt;ON THE RISK&lt;/em&gt; (which delved into various aspects of CI coverage), I guess you could say I’m hooked. No, make that convinced. Okay, sold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I agreed to be a main platform speaker at the World Critical Illness Conference next January in Vancouver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I am prodding the Society of Actuaries to do a critical illness insurance symposium next June, somewhere in North America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s why I put the most compelling topic in twenty-first century risk management—teleunderwriting—on hold…just to write this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Word to the wise: don’t listen to those who say it won’t work. Take a real close look at critical illness insurance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Rx = Dx Part 2</title>
  <link>https://rtaylor193.github.io/insureintell-1col/node/25692</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25692" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, this underwriter addressed the core concept behind the odd equation Rx = Dx (pharmaceutical information and twenty-first century underwriting) and, in so doing, posited that pharmaceutical information could be effectively employed to facilitate the underwriting process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facilitate is a broad term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might knowing the exact medication a proposed insured is taking (whether prescribed or purchased over the counter) allow an underwriter to realize his twenty-first century mandate (to speed up the risk selection process) while, at the same time, not forsaking his accountability for mortality results?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using this exact pharmaceutical information to triage medical histories and to distinguish risk scenarios which are approvable as presented from those which truly justify further underwriting. And, in so doing, not ordering physicians’ records (and other expensive, time-consuming requirements) he really doesn’t need in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the February “Rx = Dx” essay, a statement was briefly made to the effect that our industry needs to trim back on its use of the APS. There are imposing issues and considerations which, taken collectively, compel us to deal with what is clearly a prevailing industry-wide state of APS overdependence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues include the need for acquisition expense control, faster application-to-issue turnaround, and the potentially more ominous impact of increased clinical genetic testing and government-mediated mandates with regard to confidential medical records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What percentage of APS reports, currently ordered, might be expendable? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer will vary greatly from insurer to insurer, driven by a wide range of variables including mix of business, distribution system(s), average face amount, quality of underwriting support systems, experience and savvy of underwriters, perceived protective value of other risk assessment enhancements, reinsurance arrangements, and so on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are any APS reports absolutely essential? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine trying to properly appraise a history of Level IV melanoma or four-vessel bypass without critical details which can only be derived from an APS! But these cases are, after all, the exceptions, aren’t they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact remains that most impairments affecting most proposed insureds are less portentous than invasive cancer or advanced atherosclerotic lesions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we combine what we learn from Part II of the application, a telephone interview, and a lab test profile with accurate information pinpointing the proposed insured’s use of Rx, we should be able to render many proper underwriting decisions without that inexorable APS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in histories of colitis representing potentially life-endangering bowel disease versus those likely to be self-limited with no excess mortality. Or perhaps in cases of chest pain needing further investigation versus those which, based on what is already revealed to us, are clearly not germane to risk. And so on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where does the underwriter find accurate information about current/recent Rx use by proposed insureds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two sources. One, as old as underwriting itself. Another, brand new and quite novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first source is the application process.&lt;/strong&gt; Which means all that is recorded on the Part II (virtually every application asks at least a semi-adequate question about medication use), embellished by what is said in the cover letter (you do cover letters, right?) and disclosed during the telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the producer, this is largely under your direct/indirect control. So take these opportunities to provide accurate Rx information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of questions which, asked and answered, should assure full disclosure of risk-salient Rx facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What is the precise name (generic/proprietary) of the drug?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For what reason does your client believe he is taking it?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How long has he been doing so?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In what dosage; how many times a day?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;By mouth, via patch, by injection, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have there been any side effects or complications from this drug?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does his physician perform periodic testing (blood, urine, etc.) directly associated with the use of this drug? Encourage your client to be forthright and thorough when he is interviewed. There is no such thing as too much Rx information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, know that this issue extends beyond medications prescribed by doctors to include whatever your client chooses to take of a medicinal or health-enhancing nature…whether that happens to be an aspirin a day, a strength-enhancing supplement, 400 units of vitamin E, or ginkgo biloba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second source of Rx information is as new as it is innovative. &lt;/strong&gt;It is also very good news indeed for producers, insurers and clients alike. Whenever prescriptions are filled using pharmacy benefit cards, data are recorded and stored by entities known as pharmacy benefit management (PBM) firms. These data are used in pharmaceutical marketing and various kinds of demographic studies. They are also accessible, within certain limits, for use in risk selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a proper authorization, an in-surer can request Rx record information on insurance applicants. Some proposed insureds will have a record of having filled one or more prescriptions. Others will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information about prescribed medications revealed on these records should, of course, match what is disclosed in Part II, in your cover letter, or during the telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two firms are actively marketing proprietary products providing the insurer access to these kinds of Rx data. And their deployment in underwriting is increasing. This is good news for producers and clients, because many more applications should now be approved (or at least approvable) faster, with fewer long delays caused by ferreting out redundant physicians’ reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And given that every proposed insured is asked—at least once—about Rx use, this new underwriting tool is really no more “invasive” from a consumer’s perspective than the insurance application itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to the point, informed use of Rx information should have the effect of greatly reducing insurer use of the APS…a development, experience teaches, certain to be greeted with “cheers” from customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do believe the potential to greatly expedite approval of the vast majority of life applications appears to be at hand—at long last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
