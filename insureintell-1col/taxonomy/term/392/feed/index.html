  <title>Underwriting Requirement Practices: Always Consider the Big Picture</title>
  <link>https://rtaylor193.github.io/insureintell-1col/node/25719</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25719" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;When life insurers set their underwriting requirement practices, the primary focus has always been on protective value (cost vs. benefit). In many smaller companies lacking the resources to conduct internal studies, the usual approach is to consider the practices of larger carriers and most notably those known to routinely do such studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one can argue that protective value is not a major consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a prospective requirement fails to demonstrate a sufficient ROI, it would be a poor alternative, independent of other factors. However, when we use protective value in a vacuum, we are at risk for making serious mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this reason, all potential requirements must be held at arm’s length and vetted on the basis of factors other than protective that may contraindicate their deployment. We refer to this process as considering the BIG PICTURE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BIG PICTURE may show us powerful reasons for either discarding an existing underwriting resource or dodging a bullet by not embracing a novel option. Either way, the BIG PICTURE cannot be dismissed because of its potential for significant consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s consider some examples of how the BIG PICTURE should make us rethink requirements that might otherwise be perceived as solid choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CARCINOEMBRYONIC ANTIGEN (CEA) SCREENING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEA is a tumor marker, mainly linked to colon cancer but also sometimes elevated in other malignancies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clinically, CEA is used to follow patients treated for colon carcinoma. Post-intervention elevations have a strong correlation with disease recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike prostate specific antigen (PSA), CEA is not approved by the FDA for screening and, to our knowledge, is not used on this basis even in persons at high risk for colon cancer based on family history, polyp formation, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A protective value study on CEA screening, published in On the Risk, showed that individuals with more than minimal unexplained CEA elevations have considerable excess mortality risk. Therefore, in a vacuum, this study creates the impression that screening with CEA would be a shrewd choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BIG PICTURE says otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When elevated NT-proBNP or serum protein are elevated in ostensibly health persons, there are many possible explanations and most would not be seen as life threatening by the applicant or his attending physician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEA is different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When elevated to the extent that we would postpone coverage pending further clinical assessment, the anxiety-riddled specter of serious undiagnosed cancer is inexorably raised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has ever had a scare due to unexpected findings associated with potential cancer understands the tremendous psychological burden this experience confers on the affected individual. This underwriter walked that plank six years ago when multiple noncalcified pulmonary nodules were found incidentally and initially described by the radiologist as “50:50 for metastatic disease!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, most CEA elevations will turn out to be false-positives in asymptomatic individuals. Therefore, after putting applicants “through the ringer” we will see their fear turn to anger, fueled by their doctor’s accurate statement that “the insurance company never should have done this test in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our industry, hellbent on improving our image and being more customer-centric, doesn’t need to roll these dice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two decades ago, an insurer embraced another tumor marked called tumor-associated antigen (TAA) on the same basis: routine age/amount screening. Within a year, the fallout from this ill-advised adventure led to the test being withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sooner or later, companies that screen with other tests contraindicated for screening in a clinical setting (with good reason) will encounter the same problems. Indeed, we are already privy to one case involving a false-positive CEA that came “this close” to litigation against the insurer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might argue that there are similarities between CEA and PSA. Both are tumor markers and no doubt an elevated PSA raises the tension level in insurance applicants as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, because PSA screening remains widespread and often encouraged by urologists, there should be no basis for pushback from attending physicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, many of them will tell their patients that it was fortuitous that the problem was identified on the basis of insurance screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an insurer is obsessed with early cancer claims, there are other ways of tackling this problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screening elders with hemoglobin would also lead to the discovery of unsuspected colorectal neoplasia, while insulating us against criticism because (a) hemoglobin screening is routine clinically and (b) there are many causes for anemia other than occult cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And hemoglobin should be less costly than CEA, allowing us to screen a larger subset of applicants for the same outlay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIG PICTURE&lt;/strong&gt;: despite its cost/benefit allure, CEA screening will be denounced by applicants’ physicians, induce great anxiety during the agonizing interval until it is clinically evaluated and put us at risk for downstream consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MARIJUANA SCREENING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small (but resolute) subset of life insurers screen applicants’ urine to detect the primary metabolite of Cannabis sativa (marijuana).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least one of them asserts that this confers sufficient protective value for excess mortality. The study underpinning this statement is unpublished and thus exempt from scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After carefully researching the subject of health consequences linked to marijuana use by adults, I wrote an article published in the June 2012 issue of On the Risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That article showed that there is no evidence whatsoever for presuming that indulging in this drug confers excess mortality risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this presumption has been laid to rest by the only two published studies I was able to track down!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, pot smoking per se is not a risk factor for COPD, psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease or any other prevalent medical illness. There is some increased chance of driving mishaps but to no greater degree than that associated with driving in the wake of what most insurers would consider temperate alcohol intake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these findings are accurate, what could explain the putative excess risk attributed to testing positive for marijuana?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is likely that a positive marijuana test in adult insurance seekers is little more than a red herring. The good money says any excess mortality here is due to comorbid considerations not adequately considered before coming to the flawed conclusion that marijuana is the culprit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The argument that acquiring marijuana necessitates dealing with “criminal elements” rings hollow to anyone with any knowledge of the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prevalent practice of underwriting non-tobacco using marijuana smokers as the equivalent of cigarette consumption has now been rendered indefensible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we really want to screen for a substance that, if present, confirms nothing more than indulging in a safer recreational substance option than alcohol consumption?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be surprised if the net effect of marijuana testing is to send healthy Cannibis users to non-screening carriers, where they will be compelled by their circumstances to lie to be treated fairly!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIG PICTURE&lt;/strong&gt;: if screening tells us nothing more than the fact that an applicant is using a substance with no independent mortality implications, wouldn’t those funds be better spent elsewhere? This must be the perception of the vast majority of insurers given the low prevalence of Cannabis screening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXERCISE ELECTROCARDIOGRAM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of exercise ECGs has decreased enormously in recent years by virtue of setting progressively higher screening thresholds. Nevertheless, the practice persists among the majority of life insurers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, there is abundant protective value inherent in treadmill testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This point is not in dispute…simply because it doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reasons why we should finally put an end to this practice are all imposing BIG PICTURE concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is widely accepted that senior life insurance management has three dominant priorities where underwriting is concerned:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do it faster&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do it cheaper&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Do it in a customer-friendly manner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like no other requirement in our armamentarium, save for the nearly extinct chest x-ray abomination, the exercise ECG blatantly violates all three of these mandates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is slow&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It dwarfs all other assets in terms of cost&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is the antithesis of customer-friendly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may the argued that there was a time when exercise ECGs were needed because their payoff could not be matched by any alternative, that time has passed with the advent of NT-proBNP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact is an insurer should be able to screen at least 38 applicants with NT-proBNP for the cost of a single treadmill test!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a recent survey, the majority of chief underwriters agreed that exercise ECG screening would pass into the mists of history within 5 years. With a little help from our friends in reinsurance, perhaps we can sound the death knell of this egregious test in less than 60 months!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIG PICTURE&lt;/strong&gt;: the exercise ECG flies in the face of our mission (as conceived by the people who pay our salaries) and it no longer has a place in the financial services industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH PERSONAL PURCHASE RECORDS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is stipulated by some that insurers should ravage their current objective screening practices in favor of relying upon “the mother” of all subjective alternatives: inferences based on how applicants allocate their disposable income.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose, for the sake of argument, that this is true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does this make it prudent to go forward with this practice?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To its credit, this industry has renounced the use of race/ethnicity, religious affiliation, zip codes and sexual orientation as criteria for assessing risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These factors were not proscribed because there was no statistical basis for embracing them. Rather, they were shunned because they are, by any reckoning, grossly inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now some would have us believe that it is within rational tolerances to make dubious insurability inferences based on personal purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone with common sense would have to be disappointed if this practice did not trigger outrage on the part of producers, insurance seekers and industry regulators alike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until now, we have wisely recognized boundaries beyond which we dare no go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully we have not become insensate to the need for boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIG PICTURE&lt;/strong&gt;: use of personal purchase records in underwriting is another boundary we are obliged to recognize and sidestep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, some of you that have read this essay will take exception to one or more of these BIG PICTURE conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robust discussion based on the airing of all points of view is the best way to address these (and countless other) issues. Unfortunately, we are accorded far too few opportunities to engage in public discourse of this nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you see things differently (and are game to put your name to your views), you are welcome to share your thoughts in the certain knowledge that all (appropriately articulated) opposing viewpoints will be published here for the benefit of our 2,500+ registered members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>The Compelling Argument for Discontinuing Our Use of Screening Exercise Electrocardiography in Life Underwriting</title>
  <link>https://rtaylor193.github.io/insureintell-1col/node/25643</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25643" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the two biggest underwriting-related concerns of senior management in direct-writing life insurers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#1 – Reducing new business acquisition costs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#2 – Reducing application-to-issue cycle time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of these issues are conspicuous high priority agenda items in most companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The matter of business acquisition costs is, if anything, accentuated by the current economic environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other goals are compelling in this regard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Improve our image with consumers&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Make it easier for customers to do business with us as a “financial services” industry&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Facilitate – rather than obstruct – the flow of new business&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Recruit and retain producers by offering accommodating requirements while preserving and enhancing favorable mortality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What strategies have 21st century life insurers embraced to facilitate these outcomes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Teleunderwriting – the core change in how we manage new business and now the dominant mode of risk appraisal in North America and United Kingdom, and rapidly being embraced worldwide&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;New business processing systems including so-called “underwriting engines”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Automated data search and retrieval in lieu of traditional routine inspection reports&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Electronically obtained motor vehicle reports (MVRs) and pharmacy (Rx) profiles&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Steep reductions in the use of MD examinations and chest x-rays&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the #1 remaining “eye sore” among routine screening medical requirements?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exercise electrocardiogram, or, if you will, treadmill stress test (TST).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are treadmill stress tests used extensively in the industry?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2007 Life Underwriting Requirements Survey of over 125 U.S. direct-writing companies, we learned the following regarding the use of exercise ECGs as screening requirements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;62.9% of respondents continued using the TST at some age/face amount threshold.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The substantial majority of companies still using TSTs did not mandate them for any amount of coverage under age 35, but most persisted in requiring them at ages 45 and 55.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Most users required TSTs at face amounts of $5 million or higher, but a significant % continued to demand them for amounts as low as &gt; $1 million at ages 45 and over.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;96% of TST screening companies required them at age 65.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;64% required them at age 75.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;55% still required TSTs over age 75&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;62% said they would continue to require TSTs even if reinsurers did not compel them to do so.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TST Screening: The Clinical Perspective&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the treadmill stress test used too often in clinical medicine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“It is likely that it is considerably overutilized…and, in many cases, actually abused as a tool in the clinical armamentarium available to all practitioners of medicine.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

52(2001):729&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it widely held that TSTs should not be used for screening in clinical medicine?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes…and it has been for 30 years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“An expert panel of cardiologists stated that there were ‘no conditions for which there is general agreement that exercise testing is justified’ in asymptomatic persons.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Annals of Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
110(1989):456&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The exercise test historically has been considered a potentially useful modality for coronary disease screening… Nonetheless, the relatively poor accuracy of exercise electrocardiography for diagnosing hemodynamically significant coronary disease, even in symptomatic subjects, has led to recommendations against the use of exercising testing as a screening tool, as well documented by a recent report from the US Preventive Services Task Force.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Circulation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
112(2005):771&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The existing data indicate that although disease may be identified, many more patients have false-positive tests. The consequences of such findings include…misuse of data to influence employment and insurance decisions.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

30(1997):260&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the years in which the three reports cited above were published!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is this view also held by experts in primary care?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Use of the ETT &lt;/em&gt;[exercise treadmill test] &lt;em&gt;to screen for CAD in asymptomatic low-to-moderate risk individuals is not indicated.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the TST have value in screening healthy subjects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study of 4,334 adults, median age 51, there was no significant difference in mortality between those with positive vs. negative tests. The authors made the following statement in the wake of their findings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Exercise treadmill testing in such a low-risk population…was unlikely to be useful… Routine exercise treadmill testing in asymptomatic individuals has low clinical yield and it is not a cost-effective strategy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

81(1998):219&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of insurance applicants screened with TSTs are just that: asymptomatic low-to-moderate risk individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the sensitivity and specificity of the TST adequate to justify screening of asymptomatic, low-to-moderate CV risk subjects?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The ETT is known for its low sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Most patients with subsequent cardiovascular death have a negative test result, because the sensitivity for detecting subsequent cardiovascular death is low.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the “fly in the ointment” of using TST screening on asymptomatic and low-to-moderate risk individuals?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pretest probability of disease is low, even over age 60, in the absence of chest pain or equivalent suspicious symptoms. [Gibbons]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Framingham study showed that only those with “the highest CHD risk” should be considered for such testing. [Balady]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is TST screening obsolete?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Myocardial infarcts often appear to be caused by ‘insignificant’ lesions by coronary angiography”&lt;/em&gt;…and these insignificant lesions, because they do not obstruction blood flow in the arteries, do not cause the TST to be positive, resulting in disconcerting numbers of false-negative tests in high risk cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there significant risks associated with treadmill stress testing which insurers using them, especially at older ages, need to consider?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Both myocardial infarction and death…can be expected to occur at a rate up to 1 per 250 tests. Good clinical judgment should therefore be used in deciding which patients should undergo exercise testing.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gibbons&lt;br /&gt;
Op. Cit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“…the annual rate of exercise-related cardiovascular events among high-risk events may be substantial, with 0.2% of hypercholesterolemic man having an exercise-related event annually…the annual incidence of exercise-related AMI &lt;/em&gt;[acute myocardial infarction] &lt;em&gt;could range from 1 AMI per 593 to 1 per 3852 healthy middle-aged men.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The medical literature is replete with case citations of MIs and cardiac deaths in persons subjected to TST screening, even with normal treadmill findings and where these tests are done under the direct supervision of cardiologists [Baroffio, Boubrit, Brown, Capezzuto, Gómez-Jauma, Jenkins, Kurata, Lintgen, RuDusky, etc., et al]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our system of ordering and undertaking TSTs does not allow for credible judgment to be brought to bear as to whether or not a given applicant is a suitable risk. Indeed, one can only marvel at the fact that, in the age of compliance and growing concerns for equivalent vulnerabilities, the majority of insurers continue to wilfully endure these risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What have we learned from these clinical studies and findings of experts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TST has been judged to be inappropriate for screening of asymptomatic individuals by experts in cardiology for 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TST has insufficient sensitivity, specificity and accuracy to justify screening in persons with low-to-moderate risk of coronary disease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TST does not pinpoint the individuals with vulnerable disease at highest mortality risk; rather, it is positive for the most part in persons with fixed, stable coronary disease whom we now regularly insure on a highly favorable basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The TST imposes upon insurers the very real risk of heart damage and death in applicants as a direct result of routine screening. Indeed, we were told by a prominent chief medical officer that there have been multiple such occurrences in one country where TST screening is (or at least once was) done for insurance purposes. [Bond, personal communication, 2007]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of all of these blatant contraindications, most U.S. insurers continue to require screening exercise electrocardiograms, in many cases over age 75.&lt;br /&gt;
Industry-Specific Issues with TST Screening&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the additional “common sense” arguments against TST Screening by life insurers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cost: &lt;/strong&gt;According to one major industry provider, the standard fee for insurance treadmill stress testing was $713.95 as of February, 2007 [Sears, personal communication]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slowness:&lt;/strong&gt; It is widely appreciated that the turnaround time with TSTs is longer than it is, on average, for obtaining medical records from physicians. This would make the TST, along with the chest x-ray, one of the two slowest requirements we currently use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Client Unfriendliness:&lt;/strong&gt; It goes without saying that nothing we do for underwriting purposes can compare with the inconvenience to our customers that occurs with treadmill stress testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subjectivity:&lt;/strong&gt; Unlike most of our contemporary screening tools (resting ECGs and chest x-rays being the other exceptions), TST analysis is highly subjective. Thus, it is commonplace for insurance medical directors to disagree with applicants’ attending physicians over how putative TST findings should be seen from a risk perspective. As a result, they get into counterproductive exchanges of correspondence with these physicians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processing Time: &lt;/strong&gt;Because virtually all TSTs are analyzed solely by medical directors, the processing time is longer for this requirement – again, except for the odious chest x-ray – than any other screening asset in our armamentarium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do other screening options exist that would – at the very least – replace the ostensible protective value of exercise electrocardiograms…without all of these many disadvantages?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Absolutely!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, compelling evidence has shown that two inexpensive tests – which can be readily completed in conjunction with the inevitable blood profiles required on all cases where treadmill testing is now required – provide outstanding value in screening for cardiovascular risk in older-age applicants:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NT-proBNP –&lt;/strong&gt; probably the finest screening test in the history of life insurance, based on a comprehensive review of the world literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hemoglobin A1-c&lt;/strong&gt; (HbA1-c, glycosylated hemoglobin)&lt;strong&gt; – &lt;/strong&gt;a test used by underwriters in known diabetics and individuals deemed at increased risk for diabetes, HbA1-c has now been convincingly shown to have significant protective value as a screening asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are a number of other blood tests which should be considered for use in conjunction with NT-proBNP and HbA1-c as adjunctive screening tests, perhaps in a special profile to be used at older ages and for larger face amounts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cystatin C – &lt;/strong&gt;a kidney disease marker which will shown – in a comprehensive literature review to be published shortly – to have additive value as a screening asset when used with NT-proBNP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hemoglobin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; –&lt;/em&gt; given the well-demonstrated association between mild anemia (low hemoglobin) and circulatory disease, occult cancer and all-cause mortality, insurers should investigate its potential as a screening asset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRP&lt;/strong&gt; (formerly hs-CRP) &lt;strong&gt;–&lt;/strong&gt; this test was evaluated some years ago by several carriers (unpublished studies) and its use discouraged for reasons not entirely clear to this underwriter. The recent literature shows a strong association between CRP elevations and the risk of CV disease and it argues for further consideration of CRP in underwriting screening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of the far lower cost of screening with such a profile, we could test 15 or more applicants for the same out-of-pocket cost for a single exercise electrocardiogram!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does use of exercise electrocardiography continue to compromise our efforts to make underwriting faster and more cost-effective?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lassitude on the part of many direct insurers, who fail to consider this issue (apparently, in many cases, preferring instead to nibble at “low-hanging fruit” where expense containment is concerned).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sustained pressure from some reinsurers, who conveniently look away from the TST’s many drawbacks – in part because they are not directly affected by these adversities – while at the same time refusing to examine ever-increasingly evidence for viable alternatives as cited above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The insidious actions of individuals who either harbor a misperceived “vested interest” in retaining TSTs or have not taken the time to objectively consider all of the evidence here. Instead, they opt for arguing that because clinicians do not screen with these new assets (yet), such screening should not be undertaken by insurers. This, of course, flies directly in the face of the fact that clinical medicine does not screen with other mainstays of insurance screening – for example, cotinine – and furthermore that we do not have to justify to anyone outside our industry any well-reasoned decision to use any (at least, non-genetic material based) test!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What needs to be done?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliminate treadmill stress test screening in life insurance underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace whatever any genuine protective value we got from TSTs with that conferred by one or more alternative blood test options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retain the use of elective TSTs in only in circumstances, on jumbo cases, where no other viable option exists and at no time beyond a prudent maximum applicant age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By making these overdue changes, we will take an important step toward bringing 21st century underwriting screening practices in line with key business priorities of direct-writing life insurers.&lt;/p&gt;
