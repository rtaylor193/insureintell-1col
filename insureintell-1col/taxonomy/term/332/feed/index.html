  <title>Reducing Our Use of Medical Records</title>
  <link>https://rtaylor193.github.io/insureintell-1col/node/25704</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25704" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prevailing mantra of senior management regarding underwriting and most other operational functions is "faster, cheaper, better."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief underwriters are obliged to take whatever steps they can to address this in literally everything they oversee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Call it an APS, GPR, PMAR or by any other name, a report from the insured's doctor remains the cornerstone of medical underwriting. Indeed, few would argue with the statement that these reports confer substantial protective value…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…that is, of course, when their use is optimized with appropriate guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Medical record use in risk appraisal has some major issues:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They are increasingly expensive and their cost continues to rise steeply.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;They are notoriously slow to acquire and predictability the last evidence in hand on most cases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the impact of electronic medical records remains uncertain at best. Some believe e-records will expedite access. Recent experiences with e-records do not necessarily support this presumption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, we do not know whether e-records will result in physicians keeping two sets of records and sequestering vital information to which we may not be privy. There is also the matter of the extent to which patients may be able to influence and even alter their content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What are our options?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are precious few steps we can take to cut back on our use of (actually, dependency on) medical records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many American companies have substantially reduced the number of "age/amount" medical reports they require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the term suggests, these are ordered on the basis of the proposed insured's age and the amount of coverage applied for, without regard to whether any significant medical history is acknowledged at the time of the application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is one thing to eliminate "age/amount" reports on younger persons and quite another to do so at older ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already see too many elder applicants that cannot "recall" any encounters with physicians. This makes foregoing records at older ages when a personal physician is named a worrisome proportion… even in the absence of an acknowledged risk-relevant history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another strategy for paring back medical record ordering is to identify circumstances, based on admitted disorders or symptoms, where underwriters can be encouraged to steer clear of ordering an APS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, we could mandate that no medical reports will henceforth be pursued on applicants who say they were told they have fibromyalgia or if a benign tumor was excised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Problem is, there is an imposing "dark side" to this approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have more than a few cases where a GP's diagnosis of fibromyalgia was changed to rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus after referral to a rheumatologist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there are so many "benign" tumors with substantial insurability implications that we are devoting an entire CE course to this subject in 2014!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the most effective solution to the APS dependency syndrome?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary obstacle limiting our capacity to designate scenarios where underwriters should abstain from getting medical records is that we often do not have sufficient information to make a sound triage decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our capacity to safely defer medical records is directly proportional to two factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The quantity and quality of the information we get&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The ability of underwriters to use what they do have to make a sound triage (get records vs. act without them) decision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A sound approach to gathering risk-related history may bestow a virtual cornucopia of information upon the underwriter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, if the underwriter lacks the necessary knowledge and/or does not have high-caliber guidelines to separate wheat from chaff, the result will be a protracted risk assessment process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most insurers have walked away from traditional methods of risk-history taking in favor of teleinterviews or, more recently in America, so-called "smart" paramedicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both, the key component is the drilldown. This is where the impairment or symptom is greatly amplified by scripted questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the ideal questions are asked by a skilled history-taker, we should have the quantity and quality of information we need to make a sound triage (get APS or forego it) decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assuming we do get this information via drilldowns, then the second factor comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does the underwriter have – in terms of training, experience and, above all, cogent guidelines – what is needed to make the triage decision?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having adequate guidelines is a major issue here because most existing guidelines do not directly match up with information taken on drilldowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do we remedy this bottleneck?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer is easy to explain but far more difficult to implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need expert guidelines addressing each aspect of the impairment or undiagnosed symptom as reflected in the drilldown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to age and gender, these aspects include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The nature of the symptoms&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The number and duration of episodes&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The interval since the most recent symptom&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The ostensible diagnosis (if any)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The tests undertaken or advised to make a diagnosis&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Whether or not the applicant was seen in an emergency care environment and/or hospitalized&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Treatment(s) given and any interval changes in these treatments&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Significant specific medical advice, such as limit heart rate increase), and so on…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If these questions – plus selected others on an impairment-specific basis – are adequately asked and answered by interviewers, they can be fitted to specific paradigms to facilitate optimal APS triage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a high quality paradigm model we would identify 50%+ of the cases where we would have otherwise spent unnecessary sums while enduring grievous delays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the quality of our underwriting actions on those 50%+ cases would also be outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all comes back to the caliber of our risk triage paradigms and how effectively they correlate with teleinterview and similar modes of history taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our guidelines must be expertly crafted using the latest developments in medicine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on our recent experiences working with reinsurers and others, we know now that this can be done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when it is, we will finally be able to minimize the cost and turnaround time issues inherent in using medical reports to underwrite risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Rx = Dx Part 2</title>
  <link>https://rtaylor193.github.io/insureintell-1col/node/25692</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25692" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February, this underwriter addressed the core concept behind the odd equation Rx = Dx (pharmaceutical information and twenty-first century underwriting) and, in so doing, posited that pharmaceutical information could be effectively employed to facilitate the underwriting process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facilitate is a broad term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How might knowing the exact medication a proposed insured is taking (whether prescribed or purchased over the counter) allow an underwriter to realize his twenty-first century mandate (to speed up the risk selection process) while, at the same time, not forsaking his accountability for mortality results?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By using this exact pharmaceutical information to triage medical histories and to distinguish risk scenarios which are approvable as presented from those which truly justify further underwriting. And, in so doing, not ordering physicians’ records (and other expensive, time-consuming requirements) he really doesn’t need in the first place!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the February “Rx = Dx” essay, a statement was briefly made to the effect that our industry needs to trim back on its use of the APS. There are imposing issues and considerations which, taken collectively, compel us to deal with what is clearly a prevailing industry-wide state of APS overdependence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These issues include the need for acquisition expense control, faster application-to-issue turnaround, and the potentially more ominous impact of increased clinical genetic testing and government-mediated mandates with regard to confidential medical records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What percentage of APS reports, currently ordered, might be expendable? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer will vary greatly from insurer to insurer, driven by a wide range of variables including mix of business, distribution system(s), average face amount, quality of underwriting support systems, experience and savvy of underwriters, perceived protective value of other risk assessment enhancements, reinsurance arrangements, and so on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are any APS reports absolutely essential? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine trying to properly appraise a history of Level IV melanoma or four-vessel bypass without critical details which can only be derived from an APS! But these cases are, after all, the exceptions, aren’t they?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact remains that most impairments affecting most proposed insureds are less portentous than invasive cancer or advanced atherosclerotic lesions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we combine what we learn from Part II of the application, a telephone interview, and a lab test profile with accurate information pinpointing the proposed insured’s use of Rx, we should be able to render many proper underwriting decisions without that inexorable APS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in histories of colitis representing potentially life-endangering bowel disease versus those likely to be self-limited with no excess mortality. Or perhaps in cases of chest pain needing further investigation versus those which, based on what is already revealed to us, are clearly not germane to risk. And so on…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where does the underwriter find accurate information about current/recent Rx use by proposed insureds?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two sources. One, as old as underwriting itself. Another, brand new and quite novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first source is the application process.&lt;/strong&gt; Which means all that is recorded on the Part II (virtually every application asks at least a semi-adequate question about medication use), embellished by what is said in the cover letter (you do cover letters, right?) and disclosed during the telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the producer, this is largely under your direct/indirect control. So take these opportunities to provide accurate Rx information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a list of questions which, asked and answered, should assure full disclosure of risk-salient Rx facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;What is the precise name (generic/proprietary) of the drug?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;For what reason does your client believe he is taking it?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How long has he been doing so?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In what dosage; how many times a day?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;By mouth, via patch, by injection, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Have there been any side effects or complications from this drug?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Does his physician perform periodic testing (blood, urine, etc.) directly associated with the use of this drug? Encourage your client to be forthright and thorough when he is interviewed. There is no such thing as too much Rx information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, know that this issue extends beyond medications prescribed by doctors to include whatever your client chooses to take of a medicinal or health-enhancing nature…whether that happens to be an aspirin a day, a strength-enhancing supplement, 400 units of vitamin E, or ginkgo biloba.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second source of Rx information is as new as it is innovative. &lt;/strong&gt;It is also very good news indeed for producers, insurers and clients alike. Whenever prescriptions are filled using pharmacy benefit cards, data are recorded and stored by entities known as pharmacy benefit management (PBM) firms. These data are used in pharmaceutical marketing and various kinds of demographic studies. They are also accessible, within certain limits, for use in risk selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a proper authorization, an in-surer can request Rx record information on insurance applicants. Some proposed insureds will have a record of having filled one or more prescriptions. Others will not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The information about prescribed medications revealed on these records should, of course, match what is disclosed in Part II, in your cover letter, or during the telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two firms are actively marketing proprietary products providing the insurer access to these kinds of Rx data. And their deployment in underwriting is increasing. This is good news for producers and clients, because many more applications should now be approved (or at least approvable) faster, with fewer long delays caused by ferreting out redundant physicians’ reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And given that every proposed insured is asked—at least once—about Rx use, this new underwriting tool is really no more “invasive” from a consumer’s perspective than the insurance application itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to the point, informed use of Rx information should have the effect of greatly reducing insurer use of the APS…a development, experience teaches, certain to be greeted with “cheers” from customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do believe the potential to greatly expedite approval of the vast majority of life applications appears to be at hand—at long last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
