  <title>Teleinterview Drilldown Questionnaire for Childhood Cancer Survivors</title>
  <link>http://insureintell.github.io/node/25738</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25738" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;After writing a comprehensive CE (continuing education) course on the late underwriting implications of childhood/adolescence cancer, it was clear to me that companies doing teleunderwriting need a specific drilldown questionnaire to adequately address this subject. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more childhood/adolescence cancer patients survive for decades after apparent cure. Many experience significant complications arising years to decade after completion of all treatment.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These individuals are apt to have a unique appreciation of the need for insurance and may be avid seekers of all lines of coverage. At least some of them may also be less than fully candid about their cancer history, a disposition insurers often unwittingly facilitate by asking a paucity of questions about remote cancer histories! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The delayed (late) effects of treatment – mainly radiation and chemotherapy – are a major insurability concern. This is mainly true for certain malignancies, (e.g., Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, brain tumors, bone tumors), which also happen to be among the most prevalent types of curable childhood cancer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brand new study of childhood cancer survivors undertaken at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom made a startling discovery: these individuals were 5 times more likely to disclose information about treatment complications to non-physicians contacting them by telephone or postal questionnaire…than they were to their own doctors. [Taylor. &lt;i&gt;European Journal of Cancer&lt;/i&gt;. 46(2010):1069]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So much for relying solely on medical records in this context! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questionnaire below attempts to get at the issues that matter most in these cases. We are pleased to offer it to you as a potential addition to your teleinterview drilldown questionnaire set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You probably will not need to use it very often…but when you do it could have a significant impact on how you underwrite the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;QUESTIONNAIRE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At what age were you diagnosed and treated for cancer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What type of cancer did you have?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “unknown”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    A. Where in your body did the cancer occur?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How were you treated for this cancer?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “surgery”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On what parts of your body was surgery performed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “chemotherapy”: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                A. How many chemotherapy drugs did you receive?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                If “unknown”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                    a. Did you receive more than one?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “radiation therapy”: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What parts of your body were treated with radiation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “unknown”: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;      a. Did you have radiation to more than one part of                        &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;          your body? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “bone marrow transplant”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;                A. At what age did you have this procedure done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you require further cancer treatment at a later date?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “yes”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long after your first treatment did you receive additional treatment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What types of additional treatment were you given?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you get additional treatment more than one time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “yes”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. How many times did you get additional treatment after your first round of treatment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. In what year were you treated for the last time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. What types of treatment did you get the last time you were treated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you experience any treatment-related complications or other problems? I am specifically referring now to any complications or other problems that were either still present or first occurred at least 1 year after your treatment ended.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “yes”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please briefly describe those complications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you receive any treatment for these complications?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     If “yes”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. Please briefly describe the treatment you received&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When is the last time you saw a physician for reasons related to these complications?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you continue to have any symptoms or other difficulties related to these complications?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “yes”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;a. Please briefly describe these symptoms or difficulties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;b. Do you receive any type of treatment for these symptoms or difficulties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;c. Do these symptoms or difficulties interfere with your daily activities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “yes”: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. How do they interfere with your daily activities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;d. Has your physician asked you to restrict or limit any activities due to these symptoms or difficulties?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “yes”: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. How has your physician restricted or limited your activities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When is the last time you saw a physician for any kind of follow-up care or evaluation related to your history of cancer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What tests did that physician do the last time you saw him for this reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you been advised to have additional testing in the future for this reason?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If “yes”: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     A. How often?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the name and address of the physician you are seeing for followup care related to your history of cancer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there anything else you would like to share with us regarding your history of cancer?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This lecture was presented at a conference hosted by the brokerage association NAILBA in Chicago on May 13-14. It is based largely on the results of the 2009 SCOR Global Life Re Teleunderwriting Survey and focuses mainly on survey findings for North American companies doing teleunderwriting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Report of an Underwriting Practices Survey on Underwriting Audits, Teleunderwriting &amp; Pharmaceutical Databases</title>
  <link>http://insureintell.github.io/node/25636</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25636" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This survey was undertaken by sending questionnaires to 55 North American life and health insurers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of that group, 45 responded. Not bad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is ﬁrmly against my policy to name companies in the context of any survey or to make them identiﬁable in any way based on their responses. Sufﬁce to say that the majority of the TOP TWENTY life carriers are here. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My personal comments are in italics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are the tabulated replies. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part One: Auditing Underwriters (Excluding Reinsurer Audits) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. How often to you audit your underwriters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Number of Companies Response&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;15 Monthly&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;11 Quarterly&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;9 Semi-annually&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;4 Annually&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 Continuously*&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;2 Varies by level&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Weekly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*One wonders if they do much else! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Do you perform these audits internally or outsource this function&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Internally 44&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Outsource 1*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* Brisk market for us consultants! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it always wise not to get a “second opinion” from experts when so much is on the line? Reinsurer feedback can be outstanding but you also have to consider that their agenda and yours are not necessarily the same. The value of independent opinions, especially in the age of Compliance Departments, has its merits&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Do you undertake training for underwriters based on ﬁndings from audits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;YES 38&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;NO 7*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Why would any company do audits and then not use the results for training? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maybe they spend all their time producing with little or no training and just grow more and more out of touch with each passing day? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rumor has it there are such “sweat shops” out there, to the distress of their mortality and morbidity. “Pay me now or pay me later,” eh? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Other than those focused solely on billing or time service, do you undertake audits of your service providers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;YES 20&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;NO 25*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;Considering what is at stake, one would think ALL companies would do some kind of assessment of the “bang” they’re getting for lots of bucks! Maybe it is simply a matter of time and staff…in which case, know that some of us can help out here. Us “ex-vendor” types have eagle eyes! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. If YES, which services to you audit? Please check all that apply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;17 Paramedicals&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;13 Laboratory testing services&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;10 APS collection services&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;3 “complaints, other, not sure which”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part Two: Teleunderwriting &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Are you actively using teleinterviews with drilldown questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;YES 31&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;NO 14*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If NO, skip down to Part Three and continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*If these 14 are not scurrying RIGHT NOW to get started, they are destined to “wake up” in the very near future when “top brass” come down to visit and ask why competitors are doing more, for less, faster… and stealing away their producers in the process. Not a very pleasant thought. It won’t be long before conventional underwriting is obsolete, save for, perhaps, the very largest cases, and then mainly at older ages and in the substandard market only. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Do you perform all teleinterviews inhouse, outsource them all to a service provider or do both in-house and outsourced interviews?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;13 Outsource all*&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;9 Inhouse all&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;9 Both outsource and inhouse**&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*This split is probably narrower than it is industry-wide. My take is that at least 75% of companies outsource entirely. These results are skewed toward inhouse because of the relatively larger size of respondents. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;** This approach has gained favor of late. Good way to compare which approach produces the best protective value and “cost vs. beneﬁt.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If y&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ou outsource some or all of your teleinterviews: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Do you use one of the “Big Three” providers (EMSI, LabOne or Portamedic) or another ﬁrm?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;15 One of the “Big Three”*&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;7 Another ﬁrm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*This result may be skewed a bit by the presence of a handul of health companies in the survey, who are more apt to use “other” ﬁrms because of concern for perceived “special needs” (which I remain convinced are not all that special!) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Do you audit your outsourced teleinterviews for quality and/or for time service?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quality&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;YES 17&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;NO 5*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time Service&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;YES 11&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;NO 11*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Ok, in a ﬁreﬁght, quality is more important than time service (but not by much). Still, how can you put so much of your mortality/morbidity bottom line in the hands of outsourced providers and not AT LEAST audit the quality of what you get back? This raises issues about the competence of underwriting management in my view. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And how can 50% of respondents say that they will stand soundlessly with their mouths open when their boss asks how long it takes to get the interviews done? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. How satisﬁed are you with the overall quality of outsourced teleinterviews?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;15 Very&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;7 Somewhat&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;0 Not at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. How satisﬁed are you with the time service of outsourced teleinterviews?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;15 Very&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;7 Somewhat&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;0 Not at all&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wonder if these boxes were not simply checked without a lot of thought (or database with which to reply) by at least some survey respondents. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To know if you are satisﬁed or not, you need to look! Again, where quality is concerned, the impact of unfavorable interview quality could be disastrous (APS reports ordered where not need, not ordered where truly needed, bad decisions). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One critical aspect I should have asked about is how companies generate their drilldown scripts. I know from experience that almost none of them use generics provided by service ﬁrms. But, do they optimize the quality of their scripts? Along with the capabilities of the teleinterviewers, this is where the buck stops. Garbage in – Garbage out and vice versa. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you do some or all of your teleinterviews inhouse: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Do you audit them for quality?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;YES 11&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;NO 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. Do you audit the turnaround time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;YES 16&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;NO 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. Do you provide ongoing training for your teleinterviewers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;YES 11&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;NO 7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Egad, how can turnaround time outperform quality by 3 to 1? Where are our priorities? Quality is #1. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Period. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have seen the effects of training for teleinterviewers. I have also seen the quality of work done by untrained people who have no clue what they are asking about or why they are asking. It is beyond silly to expect to get high quality interviews unless you provide AT LEAST the basics (interviewing skills, medical vocabulary, insights into what the key questions are trying to get at and so on). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;40% of companies with inhouse teleinterviewers provide NO ONGOING TRAINING? Lord have mercy… &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4. Do you telecommute some or all teleinterviewers or are they all based in your company ofﬁce(s)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;5 Telecommute some or all*&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;0 All housed in company ofﬁces&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;3 NO REPLY (?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Bravo! It is time to recognize the substantial paybacks from telecommuting both teleinterviewers and underwriters! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a gem of an idea, especially for companies that have limited talent available loco-regionally. I am frankly surprised that more carriers are not doing this. It is cheaper in the long run, so if nothing else it should get the CFOs smiling (sigh). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A. If you telecommute, how do you rate the quality of telecommuted interviews to those done inhouse?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;4 Superior*&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Equal&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;0 Inferior&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Hey: to all non-telecommuting companies! This has been a consistent response I have personally heard from both life and health companies that actively use telecommuting of underwriters! The ﬁxed-false-belief that people who telecommute will shortchange the company is approaching delusional. The best thing that ever happened to AOL, service-wise and in my opinion, is when they went from inhouse service people answering the phones to people in India doing it. The quality (and the cordiality) improved 200%! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have GRAVE reservations about telecommuting (or outsourcing to) people in India when it comes to actual underwriting functions…but I honestly would not rule out telecommuting/outsourcing the teleinterviewing function to India (where the oral grammar. diction and demeanor I have heard could well be a role model for some here in the USA!) until I saw it in action. Of course, you would have to solve some training logistics but it could be well worth the investment. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5. Which of these best describes your inhouse teleinterviewers:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6 Interviews done by underwriters, who also underwrite the case*&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;6 Interviews done by others who are trained for this function and do not perform other call-center type functions&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;5 Interviews done by others who also undertake other call center functions**&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;1 Interviews done by RNs or equivalent***&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Several of these are health companies where this practice works MUCH BETTER than it does on the life side. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thankfully, the prevalence of using underwriters to call and underwrite is low – and declining – by my count among life insurers!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;** Careful! This is fraught with problems unless these folks get some specialized education and close auditing. It is one thing to ask questions about inforce services or inquire about late payments…it is quite another to do teleunderwriting drilldowns. Sometimes what looks “cheap” turns out to very, very costly!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Garbage in… &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;***Why is there just one lonely company in this cohort? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whom better than a nurse?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She (mainly – but not always) has worked with two of the most difﬁcult genre of humans in business – patients and doctors – and has the medical vocabulary, Rx ﬂuency and other elements you need to train lay folks in. I would think that telecommuting RNs who are home with young kids or want to work part-time would be a windfall opportunity! Maybe this is because I worked for some great years with a team of RNs at my “alma mater,” who were among the sharpest and most competent folks I have ever known in 3.5 decades in this industry! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6. Do you actively encourage your underwriters to give feedback on teleinterviews and drilldowns on an individual case basis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;YES 22&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;NO 9*&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Earth to the lonely 9 – c’mon…this is too good to pass up! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Part Three: Pharmaceutical Database Services&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note: Excluding one respondent that does business only in Canada, where this service is not as yet available. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. Do you currently use a pharmaceutical database service?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;NO 27&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;YES 14*&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;CURRENTLY EVALUATING 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Actually, this is a higher percentage than I expected. Good. My view on these databases is changing from anti- to pro- the more I see. They are not perfect. What is? If they add cost-effective value, they have to be considered objectively&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. If NO, Which of the following best describes your experience with these services to date?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;9 We have never evaluated them&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;17* We evaluated them and found that they did not provide sufﬁcient value based on cost vs. beneﬁt&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	1 No answer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*I have been privy to 4 such “evaluations” and only one of them was solid by my standards. You cannot evaluate this service objectively unless you know something about pharmacology. As someone who does, I know that if you misunderstand the relation between a given Rx and a matched underwriting scenario, you will inevitably botch your assessment of protective value and thus “cost vs. beneﬁt.” Do it right or don’t do it. I Should add my phone number (!). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. If YES, How would you rate the value of this service?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;4 Provides great value&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;3 Provides adequate value&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;7* Does not provide adequate value&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* As I was just saying… Besides, there have been real enhancements in these services. An evaluation done a year ago is not sufﬁcient any longer. More than a year, forget it. Junk. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;COMMENTS on Question # 3 &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Our legal department bars their use&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Seek and ye shall receive…” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Very impressed with service now&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Too much “noise” – nothing screened or sorted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If there is an Achilles’ heel, this would be it. But then, I don’t want anyone but “me” (as chief underwriter) saying when Rx matters. Every time I have seen this done, it has been done wrong. Underwriting (and more so TELEUNDERWRITING) is about connecting all the dots. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Missing dots = mistakes waiting to happen. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Insured often says he is on Rx not shown on records&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ouch! But remember, not all drugs come through these pipelines. If you pay cash, for example, forget it. If you buy outside the states, ditto. If you get Rx via a government program, likewise (best as I know). There is no way this service can be 100% spot on…but then, which service is? Besides, I’ll take a “false negative” any day over a “false positive” in this context. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Use only on “clean” DI cases, reinstatements and claims&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And, so, if it works, then what? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Teleinterviews provide enough Rx information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They do a wonderous job. Compared to agents and parameds, it is a “no brainer” in favor of (quality) teleinterviews…but these database services also function in a “false-safe” mode with teleunderwriting, for those occasional “memory lapses” of signiﬁcance! &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fact is, I would bury all my biases both ways and test out the resource, then decide. Call it a lesson learned the hard way by an old man. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DISCLAIMER&lt;br /&gt;

  <title>Teleunderwriting: A Tale Of 21st Century Reality (Part 2 )</title>
  <link>http://insureintell.github.io/node/25635</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25635" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teleunderwriting embraces multitudes. It is, at the same time, both a technical process that reconfigures day-to-day home office underwriting and a dynamic process that affects every aspect of how we select risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore the technical aspect first. Teleunderwriting makes extensive use of the telephone as an information gathering resource. One day, the Internet should play an equivalent role…but, for now, the telephone is our focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key information gathering resource is the personal history interview (PHI). This entity may go by a variety of other names as well. However, the concept is basically the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposed insured agrees to be interviewed and, ideally, the producer facilitates completion of this vital interview by gaining his client’s agreement as to the date and time it will take place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The interview is conducted by one of three people, depending on how the insurer organizes its teleunderwriting operations: an underwriter, an in-house caller who is not an underwriter; or an outsourced caller who is not (in most, but not all cases) trained as an underwriter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(As an aside, this underwriter has yet to appreciate the merit in asking home office underwriters to undertake what is clearly an information-gathering function. The Mayo Clinic quickly discovered the down-side of asking physicians to question patients about use of alternative/complementary remedies, like St. John’s wort and ginkgo biloba. Their doctors got about half as many truthful answers as a “pleasant female voice” conducting a non-threatening, non-judgmental telephone interview! Enough said.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision to do interviews in-house (versus outsourcing them to one of a growing number of fee-for-service providers) is one of the most important decisions any company will make in its embrace of teleunderwriting. Both approaches have pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual interview may last anywhere from under 10 minutes to as long as 15 or even 20, depending on two factors: how many questions are asked and, of course, the length of the answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the interview is limited to a reprise of the risk-related questions on the application, it will be shorter than one also making use of drill-down questioning of all yes answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this context, shorter is definitely not better! Drilldown questioning is the cornerstone of the interview. Why? Because drilldown questioning elicits protective information that may allow the underwriter to make a decision without ordering more requirements!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially the attending physician’s statement (APS), which is the slowest and the most expensive underwriting tool we use. I just got a note from the chief underwriting officer of one large company undertaking a very comprehensive commitment to teleunderwriting. He tells me that in the first few months since implementation of their efforts, APS ordering is already down 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty percent! This means half of the cases that would have loitered in underwriters’ pending files for weeks (average APS acquisition time is still 15 to 20 days) came to final action in a much shorter interval. In many cases, the same day the underwriter cast his eyes on the illuminating PHI interview with drilldowns of all yes answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This underwriter, in his new life, now specializes in helping companies fashion their drilldown questions so as to optimize disclosure of risk-salient information with as few questions as possible. The better the questions, the better the protective information. Higher quality information means more decisions can be made without additional requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent conversation with another chief underwriter, whose company has been doing telephone interviews longer than most, disclosed these revelations. Turnaround time has never been faster; producers have never been more pleased. The wealth of protective information acquired via telephone interviews with drilldowns now exceeds the payoff from age/amount physicians’ reports as well as those ordered “for cause” on many impairments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, they still get APSs for invasive cancer, coronary disease, etc. No drilldown can replace the path…or cath…report. But you’d be surprised how many times the APS becomes clearly redundant in the face of an excellent PHI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The success of the personal history interview is contingent on the knowledge base of the home office underwriter. Take for example the matter of prescriptions. If I know which drug the physician prescribed, and in what dosage, I may be able to make a very significant inference as to the underwriting importance of colitis, asthma, seizures, and even chest pain, as reported in the medical history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outstanding PHIs always go to considerable lengths to pinpoint all medicines taken by the applicant…by prescription and over the counter (supplements, herbs, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This concept extends beyond prescriptions. In teleunderwriting, underwriters use this same risk triage technique when it comes to surgical procedures, diagnostic tests, symptoms experienced, and other variables that are meticulously elicited during the interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is real underwriting. No wonder most underwriters give a thumbs up to teleunderwriting once they have been exposed to it in action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking at the broader impact of teleunderwriting, we see that the goal is making as many decisions as possible, as quickly as possible, at the lowest (true) cost to the insurer—and achieving all of this without compromising mortality expectations (or causing their reinsurers to turn prematurely gray).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turnaround time will be a bigger and bigger issue in the future. &lt;/strong&gt;Non-traditional distributors, like banks and Internet providers, will make it so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Controlling costs is already a major issue. It has to be. To achieve acceptable mortality results while controlling business acquisition costs, the insurer is obliged to take a fresh look at how to select risks. What is the real cost of those chest x-rays (most of which end up being relegated to the trash heap of history) and those electrocardiograms…not to forget any APSs you don’t really need. Then there are those lab tests, medical exams, inspection reports, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The cost of a requirement is much more than the fee paid to acquire it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Important questions need to be asked and answered objectively:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How long does it take to get the requirement? Time is money.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How much does it really cost the company to make use of that requirement?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How much genuine protective value does the requirement ante up, to justify its continued employment as a screening and/or reflex tool?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recent study published in a leading cardiology journal showed that 55 percent of NFL football players have at least one significant ECG abnormality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often would such abnormalities translate into appropriate adverse underwriting action? How many of these highly conditioned, medically scrutinized individuals would you expect to (justifiably) debit significantly for ECG changes? I don’t know the answer, but I can’t believe it is anywhere near 55 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At age 25 or 30, how much does a cholesterol reading really tell us? As compared to smoking a pack a day or having a lengthy motor vehicle record?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who says, “You can’t do preferred without cholesterol?” at ages 18 to 39 and over 65? Not anyone who hasthought about the question for more than five minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do MD examiners ever find anything of value? Do they ever take a close look—you know, as they surely would if the proposed insured were their own patient—not for a one-time encounter for an insurance company?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the kinds of hard questions insurers need to roll up their sleeves and ask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’ve always done it that way,” won’t cut it. It shouldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underwriting resources that integrate into a faster, cheaper, better core risk assessment protocol will carry the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These resources include—first and foremost—the PHI with drilldown questioning, plus MIB checks, MVRs, physical measurements (especially at ages over 40), producer-facilitated oral fluid and urine profiles (in lieu of blood profiles at younger ages)…and, potentially, Rx and other database profiles which are already being offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is much more one could say about teleunderwriting. But now, at least you have a better feel for what it could (no…make that should) encompass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing is certain. The future will be challenging, as it compels us to meld underwriting savvy with the realities of the twenty-first century insurance marketplace. Good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author’s Note:&lt;/strong&gt; In August, I changed course to cover critical illness insurance. It generated more feedback to me than anything I have ever written! Awareness of and interest in this fascinating new product is growing by leaps and bounds. In June, I asked and answered key questions about what this phenomenon we call teleunderwriting is all about. If you get a chance, you might want to re-read that essay. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Reflections on Two Teleunderwriting Articles From the United Kingdom</title>
  <link>http://insureintell.github.io/node/25651</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25651" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the November, 2007 issue of General Re Life and Health’s Risk &lt;em&gt;Insights&lt;/em&gt; publication there was an article by Dave Nicholas, Underwriting Manager in the United Kingdom, titled “Using the Telephone as an Underwriting Tool.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, teleunderwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered this piece a bit belatedly and then learned of a more recent piece by Dave in the March, 2008 issue of this esteemed periodical.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reading both carefully, I e-mailed Dave and asked if he’d mind me writing about what he said, adding my own observations and comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave had no objections whatsoever (thank you, my friend!)…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and so, away we go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terminology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave used the term “telephone data capture” (TDC) as a synonym for the process of information gathering in teleunderwriting. I have never heard this term used here in the states. Be that as it may, TDC nicely captures the spirit of the teleinterview process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The use of the term “teleunderwriting” in America could be challenged as a misnomer, considering that we use it to describe information gathering rather than actual risk assessments based on teleinterview-derived information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual underwriting aspect is perceived in a more traditional sense. That is to say, the underwriter uses the interview content as a surrogate for traditional answers to application risk questions and then proceeds much as he or she would in a conventional setting by using that information with all other screening requirements in hand to make the core decision: do I need medical records (APS, GPR, PMAR)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave notes that in the states we put “underwriters on the phone” to a greater extent than in the U.K.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this I would say that while some companies (still) do ask underwriters to conduct interviews and in most cases make all possible underwriting decisions in the spot, this is mostly true for health (medical) insurance rather than life and other products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years ago, a few larger U.S. life companies tried to force the proverbial “square peg into the round hole” by compelling life underwriters to do interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Substantial attrition – underwriters leaving to go elsewhere where this “egregious demand” was not imposed on them – because talking to proposed insureds is not generally seen as an appealing task by underwriters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave observes that U.K. teleinterviews are mainly done by customer support representatives or nurses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the states, we have a wide range of individuals, based on education and experience, doing interviews. The dominant species among major outsource providers is an individual with little or no underwriting-related background or medical education. This is good news for cost control and, sometimes at least, bad news for interview quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue of interview quality and content has raised the question of whether confining the interviews to scripted questioning only is the wisest approach. Unfortunately, any move toward going off-script, even minimally, is impeded by the fact that this requires a significant degree of sophistication with regard to aspects of medical knowledge, or, at the very least, the ability to recognize when an answer is insufficient or suggestive of the need for further probing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is at best uncertain whether we can expect many U.S. outsource teleinterview providers to be able to accomplish this, at least at present and in the term-near future. Indeed, if I were disposed to organize a firm offering outsourced interviews, I would be keen to develop my calling staff in a way which they would be both fluent and comfortable with going off-script to the extent necessary to assure maximum disclosure and high quality content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosure of Sensitive Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave states – and one can only nod in agreement – that one of the greatest advantages conferred by teleinterviewing is the capacity to develop sufficient information to underwrite “sensitive” impairments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave cites psychiatric disorders and substance abuse. These are the two best examples, to which I would add sexually-transmitted disease, problems associated with sexual dysfunction (ED – erectile dysfunction – which is a prime example, and one clearly significant with regard to chronic diseases), histories of being abused and likely others as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producers (agents, brokers, intermediaries) have a track record of profound reluctance when it comes to adequately questioning their clients on these matters. Moreover, the paucity of information in medical records regarding these matters – as well at anything with the “G” word (genetics) involved – is a source of longstanding frustration to all veteran underwriters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line: if you want high quality risk histories on sensitive impairments, you must use teleinterviews executed by pleasant (ideally, female?) voices, asking questions in the gentlest manner possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing the Volume of Medical Records Needed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were it not for this consideration, then the only compelling argument for teleunderwriting that could have propelled the concept forward in the states is turnaround time…and considering that the slowest requirement is almost invariably the doctor’s report, the two core benefits of teleunderwriting (“faster and cheaper”) are enmeshed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now state without equivocation that if an insurer commences teleunderwriting and as little as one year later does not realize notable reduction in APS ordering, there is a major flaw in how teleunderwriting is being carried off by that carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The glaring flaw is underwriter reluctance to act on teleinterview drilldown content in lieu of repeating long-entrenched learned behavior: “we always get an APS for ---- [fill in the impairment].”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we address this knotty problem, we must acknowledge that, as in the U.K., most American insurers doing teleunderwriting properly have experienced a substantial reduction in medical record ordering. The relative extent of this, of course, depends on market (elderly vs. middle-aged), sums insured (jumbo vs. more modest), products (disability income vs. life) and the level at which medical reports were tracked down prior to the advent of teleinterviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know companies which have reduced their APS volume by 60% – the number cited by Dave – and others whose net reduction has been only 5% to 10%. But even a modest decline in “APS dependency syndrome” should yield benefits, which, when taken together with the others, earn the decision to embrace teleunderwriting a “thumbs up”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underwriter Reluctance To Foregoing Medical Records&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave rightly observes that “underwriters remain reluctant to discard [medical records]…” and this has been a problem here, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This insidious (one is tempted to say, internecine) problem cannot be solved with a “band aid,” much as some would wish it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least four distinct issues come into play in this regard:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;There will always be some veteran underwriters who will argue that you cannot underwrite this or that condition without medical records. They will not only resist doing so but possibly undermine ideal use of drilldown information by peers. Sometimes recalcitrant individuals need to be moved into other roles, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Underwriters must have re-training when moving to a teleunderwriting environment. This should include extended discussion of drilldown questionnaires as well as plenty of case examples.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If the underwriting manual is configured in such a way that it is APS-content dependent – and most are – this acts to inhibit interview-based decision-making and increases the likelihood that medical records will be pursued in order to fit the case into diagnosis-driven manual parameters. You will need auxiliary guidelines based on teleinterview bits of information to compensate and thereby optimize the rendering of decisions without medical reports.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Performance audits of underwriters must consistently reflect support for making decisions without securing medical records. If the audit process, conducted by veteran underwriters, “punishes” those who do this, it must inevitably incite the retrenching of old habits. Underwriters have to protect themselves and if doing things “the old way” means better performance reviews, count on them not changing their ways. Make sure the auditors are “pro-teleunderwriting” and that they reinforce the right messages!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too Much Information on Teleinterviews?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave makes the point in both of his articles about the problem of some teleinterviewers collecting “…too much or irrelevant information from the applicant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I beg to differ here, if only because of the North American mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would always err on the side of “too much” rather than risk the “alternative outcome” (not getting enough)…and this can be a mighty thin line!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The driver is, whether or not salient information is gathered by what we ask in the drilldowns. It is a sound practice, as some have found, to periodically test the validity of the drilldowns by reviewing the quantity and quality of information yielded by specific questions. In this way, those which are counterproductive can be eliminated or modified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A related issue is the “clean application.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an engine-driven environment, clean cases are ideal because they process swiftly. Those who are not using engines (which includes most U.S. companies at this writing) also appreciate the clean cases because they fit a jet-issue model handily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This said, beware the delusional thinking which assumes that “clean” necessarily means CLEAN.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am a firm believer of teleinterviewing all applicants, “clean” or otherwise…at least at some reasonable threshold of cover. We have seen too many “clean” cases achieving this status either through applicant nondisclosure or the producer “malfunctioning” in the role of information gatherer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is most worrisome on older age applicants…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…certainly at age 50+ overall and especially the elderly (who represent a rapidly enlarging proportion of U.S. new business).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, at several of my life study groups we discussed the “clean older age applicant syndrome” at length and you could sense that most chief underwriters were (correctly) leery of cases where people in their 60’s and beyond profess to have only trivial medical encounters (or, worse, no history whatsoever!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This flies in the face of common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say that you would be surprised at what we unearth with teleinterviews in “clean” scenarios. Our experience is consist with the (radical ?) notion that a completely clean application at age 60 or over is inherently uninsurable…due to the overwhelming likelihood that material matters have gone undisclosed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agents and Teleunderwriting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave speaks of concerns for “control” of the client/applicant as being the #1 issue producers have with teleunderwriting. He’s right. As I explained in an earlier essay published at this website, the fixation with “control” is, in the end, a mere “urban legend” which we can debunk easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What teleunderwriting does do…and producers should sing its praises because of it…is remove their obligation for gathering risk histories. This has always been an oxymoronic function for them and it puts them in a potential liability situation where there is nondisclosure which carriers believe was driven by the failure of the producer to do his job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were a producer, I would be delighted to dodge this “smoking gun” and have more time to sell in lieu of doing head office’s job for them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the Bottom Line?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave finishes his 2008 article with this statement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Based on our findings, we consider the advantages outweigh any disadvantages.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone who looks objectively at what we have accomplished with teleunderwriting – and here I include enhancing the quantity and quality of protective risk information as compared to prior modes of collection – and says they are opposed to using teleunderwriting…is either comatose or harbors an ulterior motive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have seen a major shift – from skepticism to embrace – where teleunderwriting is concerned amongst reinsurers doing business in North America. Whether this is based on resignation or genuine enthusiasm begs the question. What matters is that if reinsurers are quoting premiums to direct-company clients using teleunderwriting which are as good (if not better, which we are seeing now) than those offered to traditional underwriting environments, then there is nothing left to say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has come out “pistols blazing” in favor of teleunderwriting. While America has not experienced an equivalent outpouring of such “official” sentiments – nor are we likely to, considering how our insurance system is regulated – we should take comfort in the ABI’s position and recognize that not only is teleunderwriting here to stay…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…it is such a smashing success (when done right) that it has put all traditional alternatives on the path to extinction!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, again, Dave for courageously permitting me to use your two excellent articles as a baseline for this essay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, above all, thanks to you and to General Re for your unreserved endorsement of teleunderwriting!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Debunking The “Control” Myth In Teleunderwriting</title>
  <link>http://insureintell.github.io/node/25654</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25654" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a lecture I did for a state underwriting association a management underwriter for a P&amp;C-based life insurer mentioned her continuing frustrations in trying to convince their sales representatives (once again, I use this as a synonym for agent, broker, intermediary, etc.) to accept teleunderwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case…and so many others…the nidus for field resistance was their “concern” for “loss of control” over their clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “control” myth had reared its predictable head once again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time to tame this toothless tiger, lest you be next to find your back against the wall trying to debunk this deeply-flawed argument against progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Point of Clarification &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we mean by a “P&amp;C-based life insurer?” We’ll pause to define this phrase because it’s an underwriting environment where the “control” myth is particularly prevalent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“P&amp;C,” of course, refers to property and casualty insurance…that OTHER primary domain of insurance products (knowledge of which we quickly disavow when accosted by friends and acquaintances over the high cost of auto insurance!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most major U.S. P&amp;C insurers also offer life and morbidity-based products…which a small but hearty subset of their agents actually sell!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P&amp;C-based agents’ “control” issues with teleunderwriting stem from their close, long-running relationships with their clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they sell a wide range of coverages (life, health, disability plus auto, boat, homeowner and what one calls the myriad other products the P&amp;C side traffics in), they have far more client connectivity throughout the year than do agents who sell strictly L&amp;H products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because they compete mainly against agents whose companies also offer many forms of coverage, they’re fixated on keeping control over the client’s insurance buying proclivities…lest a competitor make inroads on one product and then leverage it to sell others to the customer as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence, this sales milieu predictably spawns “control” mythologizing whenever teleinterwriting comes up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Is The “Control” Myth? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A confabulatory concoction which holds that when home office types or their surrogates (outsourcing) have excessive hands-on contact with clients, the agent’s hypnotic hegemony over those clients is gutted like a freshly-caught trout!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this notion of control confabulatory?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if an agent has GENUINE control…as in, a stable of Manchurian candidates for clients, who flash anencephalic rictus grins while the agent blithely adds zeros to the proposed sums insured…that agent should be terminated with prejudice!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hopes such egregious control scenarios are the stuff of myth…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…because, if they did exist, the LEAST undesirable manifestation of agent history taking we’d be fretting over is his phrasing the tobacco usage question as “you don’t smoke, DO YOU?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly, control – sans quotation markers - better not be real, for the sake of the carrier’s bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What, then, is the real issue here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morbid fear of home office meddling…which, experience teaches, is a concern not entirely devoid of validity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the advent of paramedicals (and especially after nurses gave way to phlebotomists) we’ve all been periodically taken to task over allegedly “disheveled, malodorous, venipuncture-inept” examiners reeking…err, wreaking…havoc with “polite, patient, even-tempered, all-but-angelic” clients!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given agents’ hyperbolic personas and affection for anecdote, how could things be otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does it not, therefore, stand to reason that, upon being informed of pending roll out of teleinterviewing, thusly-disposed agents would commence writhing at the mere thought of “call center types” dragging their coveted customers away from (un)reality TV to endure a stream of nasally-droned personal questions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you actually expect your agents to get all warm and fuzzy over your teleunderwriting protocol without any effort being expended on your part to forestall such negative perceptions from gaining traction?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why isn’t an agent’s influence with his client meaningfully eroded by teleunderwriting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because he must inexorably do a fact-finding interview to determine his client’s insurance needs…and in so doing he learns as much about the client as he would have if he had been more formally involved in the history taking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without the fact-finding process, how can a rational determination be made as to which product, at what sum insured, best suits the client’s needs…let alone whether or not that client has a reasonable expectation of qualifying for coverage “as applied for?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teleunderwriting hasn’t replaced the fact-finding interview.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has made it all the more essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The competent agent must review his client’s risk history to do his job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If he’s smart, he will make use the application risk questions as a template when doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the ONLY difference where teleunderwriting is concerned?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of the agent formally – that is, “for the record,” - asking risk questions and recording answers…or….this task being carried off by a paramedical technician or physician (more likely to intimidate the client with a white coat effect)…the accountability for said “formal questioning” now falls to a non-threatening pleasant female (usually) voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agent looses no legitimate influence – “control,” if you must – over his client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, all he “surrenders” with teleunderwriting is potential liability for an untimely faux pas while questioning his client “on the record” where matters of insurability are concerned!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such unfortunate situations, wherein the agent fails to adequately ask and/or sufficiently record an answer to a sensitive question, have cost sales people their careers…for starters, so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does the “buck stop” on this issue?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the home office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because we sculpt scripts and cull callers to make certain the questions are as cogent as the callers are competent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where the primary source of your company’s revenue (agents) is concerned, it is you who will largely determine whether or not the “control” myth becomes a cause célèbre in the months before and after teleunderwriting roll out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is readily accomplishable so long as the seven benchmarks are shown respect and consideration they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the “have you” checklist of tasks to nip the “control” myth in the bud:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Made your core interview and drilldown questions comprehend-able at a grade six level of cogency (sadly appropriate for Homo sapiens)?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Wisely chosen your callers, delicately balancing cost of their services against their skill levels so as to get the very best for your money?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Adequately tested the teleinterview process with a strategically-selected cohort of agents, soliciting – and then responding – to their feedback until you have their “buy-in” to the process?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Involved these agents actively in the roll-out process, using their positivism to assuage early concerns on the part of their peers?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gone after feedback from interviewees (in a manner deferential to prevailing sensibilities), then bawdily trumpeting the rave reviews (which are inevitable, if you’ve done your job) from their clients who were teleinterviewed?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Audited your teleinterviews both for technique and content? This must include listening to a significant batch encompassing all callers (or you will have a glass half empty).&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Taken pains to learn from experience, then fine-tuning interview and drilldown questions, providing further caller training, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your score is 7 out of 7, BRAVO!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just one question remains to be asked. It may be the one you LEAST want to deal with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you commenced generalized teleinterviewing, did you give your agents the choice of submitting new business via teleunderwriting – or – in the traditional manner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the answer is (which it almost always isn’t) NO, my congratulations on your intuition, tolerance for pain and hormone levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the answer is YES, know that you have vitalized the naysayers, allowing them to recruit others to their pinpoint of view.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it is in the nature of things that there will be some bad teleinterviewing experiences, no matter how outstanding your operation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which will be amplified and extrapolated to be “the norm,” aided and abetted by throaty “I told you so” gloating from veteran agents whom your ill-fated policy allowed to opt out of teleunderwriting (just as they always do, on everything from laptops to asbestos-free insulation!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if this has happened, all is not yet lost...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…provided you can find the wherewithal to take the last essential step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which must be institutionalization of teleinterviews as the sole acceptable mode of application submission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are all seven “have you” bases covered?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If NO, you have work to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If YES, carefully choose both the timing and the technique used to bring this last bit of good cheer (and it should be nothing less!) to your agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do this wisely, teleunderwriting will prevail to your considerable credit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t, you might wish to consider a sales career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  <title>Synergy: Seizing the Opportunity Afforded by Teleundewriting to Make Strategic Changes in Your Underwriting Practices</title>
  <link>http://insureintell.github.io/node/25659</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25659" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;
      
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleunderwriting Essay 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this final essay in our teleunderwriting series, we will focus on how insurers can capitalize on the introduction of teleunderwriting to make important changes in underwriting practices. It is imperative that insurers use this window of opportunity wisely for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;It is open to you by virtue of the huge positive impact teleunderwriting will have on turnaround time for your sales force. They will be excited about this and other payoffs to them from this new process and you can leverage this to your advantage.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Almost every company in the industry has changes that need to be made regarding requirements and other practices which harmonize with teleunderwriting and/or bring advantages in other ways. Making them invariably means treading lightly. Perhaps less so in this context than at any other point.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are strategic changes in requirements essential when implementing teleunderwriting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teleunderwriting is intended to expedite the underwriting of countless cases which previously languished for want of medical records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If one is going to go this far to reduce application- to-issue processing, why not make additional complementary changes aimed at achieving the same result?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the options we propose in this regard are only available to insurers in the United States. In some cases, this may change over time. Other options are accessible worldwide…but not necessarily used in an optimal fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are requirements to consider either adding or expanding your use of because they have a significant impact on turnaround time. There are others which act in the same manner as medical records to impede and delay the process. We need to identify each group of requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements which piggyback on teleunderwriting to expedite underwriting action&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motor Vehicle Records (MVRs) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Available in the US from most states. They are rapidly acquired at low cost. The 2007 Underwriting Requirements Survey done by our company revealed that many carriers make inadequate use of MVRs. An argument could be fashioned for using them at all ages in both genders at a reasonably low sum-insured threshold. But they are most valuable in males under age 30 and in both genders at ages 65 and older for very different reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rx Profiles &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which as every US insurer should know are reports available from several service providers, showing key information about prescriptions filled by applicants over a fixed period of time (that interval determined by the insurer). It is becoming clear that their value is much greater than originally thought, especially as 70% or more of mainstream applicants will have records that we can access. We encourage all US insurers to take advantage of the white paper we did on this subject. It is free and posted here for registered users. We believe that Rx profiling is destined to become a routine age/amount screening requirement used at least as extensively as laboratory testing in the next 2-3 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oral fluid &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known (incorrectly) as “saliva testing.” This is a very attractive alternative to blood testing at ages 40 and under because, (A) it includes the major elements related to young adult mortality (HIV, drug use, tobacco/nicotine ingestion), (B) should be embellished with hepatitis C screening in due course, and (C) specimens can be readily collected by sales people (thus reducing turnaround time as compared to blood and urine, which must be paramedically collected).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skin Cholesterol &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Properly called “skin sterol” and soon to be available under the brand name PREVU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unique alternative to blood cholesterol is actually superior in terms of its association with coronary disease. This is because studies done clinically have shown that it is more closely related to the angiographically-measured degree of coronary obstruction than serum cholesterol. It is collected using a pad placed on the palm of the hand, pulled back and inserted in a mailing container. Thus, it is even easier to do PREVU tests than oral fluid tests!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having interviewed the clinical cardiologist who pioneered this test for use in healthcare and reviewed the world literature on it, we recommend it unconditionally as a rapid screening test (ideally used in tandem with oral fluid).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a superb review of PREVU in the latest issue of Hannover Re’s periodical, written by UK actuary Nigel Bradshaw. If you have access to this always-excellent publication, be sure to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To the extent that any of these assets can be built into one’s underwriting paradigm for screening, turnaround time is enhanced with no attrition in terms of protective value.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requirements whose time has passed, or whose use should be reconfigured to expedite underwriting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we consider the list of candidates here, we need to make a key observation about protective value (cost vs. benefit).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many protective value studies have been published over the last several decades, in &lt;em&gt;On The Risk&lt;/em&gt; and elsewhere. Far more have been done by companies internally, deemed proprietary and not shared. As regards this larger group, one does not necessarily need to know the formal results of such studies as they are reflected indirectly, but highly credibly, in the actions these companies take in the wake of their findings. In other words, if you see a respected company introduce a test like NT-proBNP in screening, you know they did their homework and the test has been shown to confer significant value (as NT- proBNP is certain to do).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Protective value studies may also have a “dark side.” They may be configured in such a way as to be little more than “self-fulfilling prophecies.” By this we mean that if someone has an ulterior motive for showing that a given requirement has value, they can readily mold a study toward their ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a study could appear highly credible solely based on the status of the authors. Thus, it is imperative that we never fail to consider the source, asking ourselves cui bono (who stands to gain). This is the same question criminal investigators ask when trying to decide who may have committed a murder. If we don’t ask it, we won’t be positioned to evaluate the findings carefully enough to unmask missing (or distorted) information which changes the true impact of the stated findings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many medical tests for which one could fashion “protective value” assessments. In some cases, they would be valid, reflecting all considerations that must be brought to bear before making a decision to use the test. In others, they could as easily miss (or look away from) aspects that would argue persuasively against using the test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example of this is screening with tumor markers (with the exception of PSA, for reasons we don’t have time to consider here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are steadfastly opposed to screening with ALL other known tumor markers because we appreciate the potentially-dire consequences. These ominous consequences are wholly unrelated to their putative “protective value” or “cost vs. benefit” when the mathematical arguments are seen in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These matters considered, we can now look at those requirements that need to be rethought in the age of teleunderwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chest X-Rays &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which are grossly inappropriate underwriting tests simply on the basis of exposure to ionizing radiation alone…and there are many other relevant considerations as well. Bottom line: we are a financial services industry. By what right do we do something this egregious when screening with chest x-rays is said to no longer be done routinely in patients admitted to a hospital! For more on this and the next test as well, please read ENOUGH IS ENOUGH, an essay recently published in &lt;em&gt;The National Underwriter&lt;/em&gt; and posted at our web site. The arguments made in that essay are beyond dispute – or, if someone believes otherwise, we would be only too happy to debate the issue in any appropriate forum!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treadmill Stress Tests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which have so many direct and indirect disadvantages that we don’t literally have the room to expand upon them adequately…so we will sum Teleunderwriting Essay #12 January, 2008 5 it up this way: running an insurance applicant on a treadmill is extraordinarily expensive, incredibly slow, wholly subjective in 99% of analyses of test findings, unfair to clients and sales persons alike and devoid of any protective value advantages when compared to faster, cheaper blood test alternatives that can be done (in the US) for 1/15th the cost!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resting ECGs &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which suffer from some of the same inherent drawbacks as treadmill tests. That said, we believe there is a role for ECGs at higher face amounts at ages 50 and over. Under age 50, they are, relatively-speaking, worthless when compared to faster and more productive alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal History Interviews (PHIs) and Conventional Inspection Reports &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which are effectively eclipsed by teleinterviews. The exception here…and it is a very important exception…is financial inspection reports done on larger sums insured where financial underwriting is often as important (if not more so) than medical underwriting. These reports, done properly, are priceless and cannot be replaced by teleinterviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical Exams by Physicians &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least in countries where they are significantly more costly than paramedicals. Why? Because everything we have seen to date shows that they do not confer sufficient marginal value to justify the added cost. This situation, of course, is much different in places where (a) MD exams are less costly and (b) doubly so of course when there is no established paramedical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, there are other prevalent requirements whose use may need to be changed relative to the present. Accomplishing this at the same time teleunderwriting is introduced is, if nothing else, practical. You are going to present your new teleunderwriting process to your sales people in a major way. Why not use that opportunity to also introduce changes in other underwriting requirements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blood and Urine Profiles &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have very great protective value at age 40 and over. On the other hand, it has been shown that their value at younger ages is modest at best, justifying raising blood/urine screening levels at these ages. In the 2007 Requirements Survey, the majority of companies were still “flat liners” in this context, requiring these tests at the same face amount threshold for all ages, or at least up to age 65 or thereabouts. No doubt this is fueled in part by the presence of blood-test mediated components in preferred risk criteria at young ages (also an issue worthy of challenge). This aspect notwithstanding, our use would be steeply graded by age, getting far more blood and urine profiles at older ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PSA &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remains necessary because of widespread routine screening of men as young as age 40-49. The potential for antiselection here is as high if not higher than with other clinical screening tests. Therefore, we advocate judicious use of PSA screening in any underwriting environment where it is done heavily in a clinical context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novel Testing Options &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should be carefully scrutinized and evaluated as alternatives to add substantial protective value when we get rid of obsolete entities like chest x-rays and treadmill tests. Among those being most widely explored now in North America are these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NT-proBNP &lt;/strong&gt;- &lt;/em&gt;which the world literature up to this point has shown to be the finest blood test ever for where heart/circulatory disease risk is concerned. See our white paper at &lt;a href="http://www.insureintell.com" title="www.insureintell.com"&gt;www.insureintell.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hemoglobin A1-c&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/em&gt;which many companies use more or less routinely in diabetics and those with elevated diabetic test components on screening blood profiles. We believe HbA1-c has value beyond these worthy uses, mainly as a screening test at ages 40 and over. We expect to see many proactive companies moving in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microalbumin &lt;/strong&gt;- &lt;/em&gt;which is underutilized even now in cases where it is all-but-obligatory (diabetes, longstanding hypertension) and would serve us well as a screening test for circulatory disease mortality and morbidity. As strong a case can be made for MA screening as for HbA1-c.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hepatitis&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/em&gt;which serves us well and should be increased in many countries. In those where HBV is endemic, it goes without saying that hepatitis B serology components pay for themselves many times over. In every underwriting environment it is likely that screening with antibodies to the hepatitis C virus would also be more than merely cost-effective. Most companies test for HCV on a reflexive basis (sometimes using, in our view, poorly-chosen criteria). There is substantial evidence to suggest that screening is well worth considering, especially at ages 50 and over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apolipoproteins&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/em&gt;which are the state of the art in terms of insurance-feasible lipid screening. The ratio of apolipoproteins B and A-I has outperformed conventional lipid tests in most studies where they have been compared head-to-head. Given their ready availability from insurance labs, we would think companies would be disposed to considering them…perhaps with NT-proBNP and HbA1-c as a CV screening package at ages 50 and over for large amounts of coverage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hemoglobin&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;/em&gt;a test we can do readily and inexpensively. Hb is a marker for both occult Fe anemia – a major source of mortality over age 55 – and for borderline/frank polycythemia (an underappreciated mortality factor). We have heard of only two pilot projects in this regard. One, which was small, was said to not show sufficient value (we did not see sufficient details to concur with that judgment). The other we know nothing further about as it is proprietary. Nevertheless, based on what we know about hemoglobin per se, we see potential here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing Comments &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the results of the 2007 Underwriting Requirements Study, what we have heard at study groups and other meetings, what we have been told of prevailing underwriting screening practices in Asia and what we know about the medical aspects of testing from clinical sources, we firmly believe that there is much work to be done by many companies to optimize how they use available assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have undertaken projects with a number of insurers in this regards as well as with their criteria used for various classes of “preferred risk” underwriting…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and without exception we have recommended dozens and dozens of areas where significant enhancements could be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will reserve comment on preferred risk aspects until our 2008 Preferred Risk Survey – currently being completed by US and Canadian life insurers – is tabulated and available for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teleunderwriting affords all who embrace it a window period of unique opportunity to make sound enhancements in all aspects of underwriting practices. Whether this is limited to requirements or should also include rethinking preferred/ coronary risk criteria, introducing a “field manual” for agents (an undertaking, by the way, gaining renewed favor) and/or many other initiatives depends, at the end of the day, of what is timely and appropriate for each carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Four Birds With One Stone*: Solving Major Producer Issues With Teleunderwriting</title>
  <link>http://insureintell.github.io/node/25660</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25660" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;

              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleunderwriting Essay 11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most arguments advanced in support of embracing teleunderwriting have to do with overall corporate and underwriting-specific objectives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We usually don’t think of teleunderwriting in terms of its broad contribution to assuaging the concerns of those who sell our products (thus, giving us a reason for being on the payroll!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This essay is a direct result of a survey report summary, published in the November, 2007 issue of &lt;em&gt;Insurance Marketing&lt;/em&gt;. This high-quality monthly circulates widely within the North American agent/ broker community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote an article for them some years ago and in so doing came to appreciate what a superb job Managing Editor Jamie Goland does. Jamie wrote the article about the survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The study itself is titled the “2007 BROKERAGE STUDY."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was done by NAILBA (the National Association of Independent Life Brokerage Agencies), a huge professional association with over 350 member agencies in North America, ultimately representing over 100,000 brokerage producers. I know NAILBA pretty well, having spoken at their annual meeting on a number of occasions and now commencing a technical project on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the core questions in the survey was phrased as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p align="left"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What do you find to be the most challenging aspects of selling insurance?” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those taking the survey were given 15 choices as well as “other.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dominant challenge is what I call a “no- brainer.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No…not getting rich (!)…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…prospecting for new business, which, of course, is what most agents and brokers must do for many years until they build a sufficient client base to thrive on referrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two out of three respondents said that this was their greatest challenge…and there isn’t much we can do about it, is there?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But now things get very interesting indeed from an underwriting perspective because what we do – or don’t do, as the case may be – contributes directly or indirectly to 4 of the next 9 ranked challenges in this survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are these challenges and how does teleunderwriting get us to the “end zone”? (to use American football term for getting the job done!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2nd Highest Ranked Challenge for Producers: “Getting a product through underwriting to issuance” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this doesn’t sound familiar, you aren’t an underwriter!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obviously, there are a number of aspects related to managing this concern, not the least of which is making informed and competitive offers when coverage cannot be approved as applied for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This, in turn, is enmeshed in company underwriting philosophy, guidelines in your manual(s), agreements with reinsurers and – we hasten to add – whether the underwriter is sufficiently up to speed on the latest developments in the impairment in question to be able to make the best possible offer!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In spite of all the foregoing considerations, however, when producers get into a rant about “getting something through underwriting,” the number one concern we hear is how long it takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How many cases wind up in purgatorial orbit while the underwriter tracks down…for the most part…slow medical records, as well as certain other tedious requirements we should be exorcising from risk appraisal?*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*See my essay “Enough is Enough” in the November 17 &lt;em&gt;National Underwriter&lt;/em&gt; about the two worst “other” culprits: chest x-rays and treadmill stress tests!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are going to solve this longstanding source of friction between underwriters and producers, we will need to direct our energies toward “changing the things we can” and “knowing the difference”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no “magic bullet” destined improve APS (GPR, PMR…) turnaround. We have tried them all and the best answer seems to be using intermediary firms to act as our advocates and actually retrieve these records on site. But even with the best of these services, we are looking at two calendar weeks as often as not (and many straggling in much later).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way to change the impact of the APS on slow cycle (application-to-issue) time is to GET FEWER OF THEM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is what teleunderwriting MUST achieve if it is to be worth the expense and time commitment needed to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, there are other things we can do – paperless environment, electronic apps, using requirements with faster acquisition times, etc. – but at the proverbial end of the day, as goes the APS, so goes turnaround time…and doubly so the producers’ perceptions of it because insurance agents and brokers tend to have highly selective recall for slow/problem cases and use them as their baseline for assessing our performance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A decision that can be made based on a teleinterview drilldown in lieu of an APS is a decision made THAT DAY…not 12-16 working days later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, if “getting the darned thing issued” is their #2 concern, then teleunderwriting affords us the best avenue to showing good faith in trying to get turnaround time reduced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4th Highest Ranked Challenge for Producers: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Getting products issued for clients with substandard health”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hear you…you’re saying “hey, this is driven by underwriting practices, not by teleunderwriting”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you’re PARTLY correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact is – except perhaps for heavily-shopped and highly-impaired business (where annuities make more sense half of the time!) – concern with issuing substandard cases is also a function of two other factors:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The requirements we use to screen risks&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The point at which the underwriter thinks he/she has enough information to act&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What determines our screening requirements?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That mix of resources we believe will provide, in aggregate, sufficient protective value relative to our mortality assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if teleunderwriting confers as much protective value as so many insurers have come to appreciate, then it should allow us to do away with onerous requirements that not only slow things down but result in unnecessary adverse actions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. market, the more use we make of Rx profiles, motor vehicle reports, producer-collected oral fluid and, likely soon, producer-collected skin cholesterol specimens, the more risk assessments we can make in less…not more…time, with fewer mistakes resulting from overly-subjective requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of “enough information to act,” wouldn’t (un-coached!) answers to 8 to 14 impairment- specific questions, taken over the phone, be more likely to empower decision-making than the caliber of risk-history information we get now on non- medicals, paramedicals and M.D. exams?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To extend the analogy…what happens when we finally get those “essential” medical records we really didn’t need?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often does the underwriter unearth some unexpected “discovery” that catalyzes yet another requirement (or two) and/or piling on of debits for what often turn out to be dubious reasons?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do underwriting audits directed precisely at this issue: jeopardizing good business by wild-goose chases, unnecessary requirements and flawed analysis of unexpected APS “findings.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of these undesirables are widespread, with insidious bottom-line implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact is, I often find that underwriters make many more bad calls in these ways than they do in their assessments of the core elements of the medical history!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One might say that teleunderwriting confers extra value simply because it is NOT awash in myriad risk-irrelevant lab test “abnormalities” and equivocal physical findings…which just happen to be the two main APS-content culprits in this context. Teleunderwriting does indeed play a key role in managing this issue raised by producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7th Highest Ranked Challenge for Producers: “Applications are too long/confusing”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk about huge direct impact zone for teleunderwriting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With teleunderwriting, we no longer insist that the producer ask and record answers to the risk related questions…which make up the bulk of the application!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, all they need to do in a full teleunderwriting environment is fill in the information needed to issue the policy and gather any documents, such as replacement forms, mandated by the company or regulatory bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When producers are compelled to handle the risk-related questions, the incidence of both inadvertent and overt nondisclosure soars, relative to teleunderwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are not professional interviewers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to the point, isn’t it inherently illogical to ask someone whose income is determined by the outcome to play a pivotal role in how that outcome is determined?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only way insurers are going to address this long-standing concern about lengthy and oft- confusing applications is to reduce the amount and complexity of the information the producer is accountable for gathering. Teleunderwriting is the answer here, hands down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9th Highest Ranked Challenge for Producers : “Lack of Support from Insurance Company Home Office”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many factors contributing to this prevalent complaint. They arise in every operational unit, of which underwriting/new business is just one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On our end, support means streamlining the flow of business and taking as many “monkeys” off the backs of producers as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that stands out prominently here is incomplete applications. In many companies, they continue to be a nagging obstacle to getting business issued.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With teleunderwriting, there are no incompletes in the risk-related portion of the application… because the teleinterviewer must ask and answer each question before moving on to the next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often do you find an impairment flagged with a check mark in the box adjacent to, say, question #14…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…but no elaboration on that check mark in the pathetically tiny area at the bottom of the medical history page where we expect the producer to scrunch in the answers to five or six questions about when it happened, tests done, treatments given, doctor/hospital contact information…and what all?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the enhancements we can make in our domain of insurance operations, none goes further in providing meaningful support for producers than teleunderwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can you – as chief underwriter – get mileage out of these revelations? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By making sure senior management and the key people in Sales and Marketing understand why they should be lining up to support – as circumstances dictate – either installation of teleunderwriting, or, its broadened deployment to encompass all (at least) fully-underwritten business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, by tooting your own horn to the producers every chance you get…in publications, during producer schools, at sales conferences and even those “spare-no-expense” reward outings!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;"How unfortunate it would be if – after investing so much time and effort – you did not get the accolades you deserve for having brought to bear so dramatic an impact on 4 of the top 9 challenges producers face every day!"&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* No, we don’t advocate throwing stones – or baseballs, for that matter – at birds! We paraphrased “kill two birds with one stone” solely for effect. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Report of a Brand New Teleunderwriting Survey</title>
  <link>http://insureintell.github.io/node/25661</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25661" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;

              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Teleunderwrtiting Essay 10&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Characteristics of Survey Respondents' Companies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have just completed a survey of 18 American life companies currently engaged in teleunderwriting. The findings should be of interest to all life and health insurers using or considering teleunderwriting. Therefore, this essay will review the results of that survey, with added commentary…as readers have no doubt come to expect from this underwriter!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using broad parameters, 9 are classed as “large,” 8 as “medium” and 1 as “small” in terms of volume of business written.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ten are located in Midwestern states, 4 in the West, 3 in the East and 1 in the South.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;40% began teleunderwriting prior to 2000 AD, whereas 22% commenced between 2000 and the end of 2002, and the remaining 38% in 2003 or later. All of have been teleunderwriting for at least two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the #1 reason your company started using teleunderwriting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have thought the 4 options presented as choices would have accounted for most answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They did not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the four optional answers offered (vs. “other” – with comment if desired), “lowering acquisition costs” was the most common response (4 of 9), followed by 3 who ticked “reduce application-to- issue” turnaround time and just 1 of the 9 choosing “to be competitive with others already doing teleunderwriting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not one respondent indicated that their prime mover was “to reduce medical record ordering”…a noble argument for teleunderwriting by any reckoning!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Off the 9 ticking “other,” 3 cite simplifying the application process, 2 indicate making applying less cumbersome for customers and 1 says the same for sales persons (agents, producers, intermediaries). The 3 other answers are: to support a rules-based engine, to improve quality of underwriting information and to improve mortality experience (which, in point of fact, competent teleunderwriting truly should!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who can disagree with any of these reasons?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On which business is teleunderwriting used? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;89% deploy teleunderwriting on all fully- underwritten business. 83% do teleinterviews at all face amounts and 94% use them at all ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These answers are reassuring, given that it makes no sense whatsoever to NOT use teleunderwriting on all applications taken on all adults.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are your teleinterviews undertaken in-house or completed by outsourced service providers?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;50% outsource entirely, 33% do all interviews with company staff and 3 of the 18 firms use both vendor-provided and internal callers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is widely said that the % of companies outsourcing teleintrviews is higher than reflected here. Part of the reason for these results, therefore, may be the relative size of respondents, as large carriers likely have a greater probability of having corporate call centers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In earlier surveys, small-to-medium sized companies were more likely to avail themselves of outsourcing than large insurers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did you get your drilldown questionnaires?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 out of every 3 respondents designed them in- house, with or without outside expert assistance. Only a third depend solely on questionnaires given to them by outsourcing providers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As 12 of 18 outsource some or all calls, only half of those with likely access to free questionnaires from service firms choose to avail themselves of same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do your teleinterview callers ever go “off-script”? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;44% said that they do indeed provide for their callers going beyond strictly scripted interviewing, which is a higher % than one would have thought (at least in the USA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has become increasingly clear of late – based on teleunderwriting audits and other undertakings of mine – that the “script-only” approach could seriously undermine one’s potential yield from teleinterviewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact is, it may be an insidious factor leading to ordering as many – if not more – medical reports in a teleunderwriting environment as one did in the past, with traditional underwriting!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be surprised if we see a groundswell of interest in adding this dimension to teleinterviews in the future (which, of course, could have significant implications for at least some outsourced providers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you rate the capacity of your teleinterviewers to get satisfactory information regarding Rx use by applicants? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most (72%) chose “good” as opposed to “great” (22%) or “poor” (6%).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One carrier provides a prep sheet for customers scheduled for teleinterviews, thus preparing them for the experience and including guidance specifically related to fully answering questions about medication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another makes a brochure covering this key subject, among others, for sales people to give to customers prior to the interview. With any luck, more than a few make their way to the interviewee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hats off to both insurers for taking an important step to maximizing disclosure of not only essential Rx details but also improving the overall caliber of interview content! You may wish to give consideration to doing likewise…small investment for a potentially major pay-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has teleinterviewing impacted your turnaround time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;38% said things are better, 22% “about the same” and the remaining 38% indicated things are not as good as they had been before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly, those whose experience has been unfavorable are mainly among those deploying teleinterviewing for a comparatively shorter time than the rest. Over the years, many insurers have reported an transient period of app-to-issue time problems early on in their teleunderwriting program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two companies with unfavorable results in this regard indicated that the culprit is delayed paramedical ordering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has teleunderwriting impacted your medical record ordering? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here the impact of teleunderwriting has been, as expected, mainly good news, with 78% now ordering fewer reports, 11% roughly the same number and only 2 of 18 experiencing an increase in the % of cases on which underwriters pursue doctor/hospital records.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One respondent commented that his company has been chastised on “every audit” by reinsurers who would have had them order more medical reports than what they were getting with teleunderwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the 2 firms now ordering more reports took a positive perspective, believing the net effect – pinpointing cases where reports are truly needed which might have been overlooked in the past – will have favorable mortality implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you audit your teleinterviewing and, if so, how often? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only 72% owned up to doing such audits (how do the others maintain their peace of mind?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who do so tend, for the most part (62%), to do these audits more than quarterly (as they should, considering what is at stake).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you satisfied with the quantity and quality of teleinterview-obtained risk information? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over half are “very” happy, whereas 2 of 18 are anything but pleased. Two companies report some deterioration in quality in the past year; by contextual inference, both outsource their calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One commented that training of outsourcer callers did not seem to be keeping pace, attributing this to the likelihood of steeply-rising volumes of business coming to their service provider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time to invoke the teleunderwriting mantra: “garbage in, garbage out”… &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…because over the years, there has been plenty of credible “circumstantial” evidence suggesting interviewer training may not be all it is often said to be, especially as regards medical aspects (rather than non-specific calling skills).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This could have major ramifications if more and more insurers want callers who can go “off-script” as needed to fill in the “blanks,” so to speak.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you satisfied with your underwriters’ capacity to make decisions based on teleinterview content? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;50% are “very” pleased, 22% “somewhat” satisfied and the remainder not one bit happy in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you feel your underwriters should be making more decisions from teleinterviews, without resorting to medical records? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half say their underwriters should be making significantly more decisions from interview/ drilldown content…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and when I asked those 9 companies what factors they feel are contributing to problems in this regard, 3 were cited:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Quality and quantity of interview information&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Reluctance to change old habits&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Difficulty equating interview information to manual guidelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All 3 can be remedied, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One wonders if the issue of “reluctance” might not be due, at least in part, to how underwriters are audited internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If audits are done by the most veteran underwriters…and if the most veteran underwriters are often (and they are) among those most resistant to changing ingrained bad habits and misperceptions…then, perhaps the “failure” of underwriters to change their old habits is a well- justified defense against (inappropriate) audit discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we need to wake up and see that the veteran underwriters do not necessarily make the best auditors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is most likely true, of course, where obsolete information inexorably calcifies in the atrophic databases of underwriters who are long on service…but short on continuing ed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last bullet point here is so important that we covered it already as the “teleunderwriting disconnect.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequent to writing that essay, I have been raising this question with more insurers, who, in turn, have consistently acknowledged its veracity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully with the completion of our teleunderwriting paradigm project in 2008, insurers will have the resource needed to bridge this disconnect and thus greatly maximize the capacity of their underwriters to make decisions without ordering those medical records they don’t really need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since the advent of your teleunderwriting program, have you changed your age/amount requirements and, if yes, have you liberalized them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Half of respondents have changed their requirements; 78% of those having made liberalizations in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undoubtedly the bounty of protective information from teleinterviews has been a prime mover in making such progress possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has been your underwriters’ reaction to teleunderwriting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;50% say their underwriters “love” teleunderwriting, 44% conclude that they merely “tolerate” it and one lone respondent takes a negative (“hate it”) tack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, chief underwriters can have a huge impact on how their staff responds to teleunderwriting…that is, if they chose to (and if they don’t bother, what does that say for them?).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has teleunderwriting had any impact on the cost of your reinsurance? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With one exception (“it reduced the cost”), all answered “no.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has been the response of your sales force to teleunderwriting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One in three say “they love it” while the remainder report tolerance. Instructively, not a single respondent chose the “they hate it” option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So much for that myth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you allow your sales folks to choose between teleunderwriting vs. conventional underwriting on the business they submit? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predictably – and, sadly – 2 out of 3 permit producer-mediated antiselection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I asked those who allow this if they intend to see the light and go over to “mandatory teleunderwriting” down the road, only 1 in 3 confess this intention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, 8 out of 18 intend to facilitate avoidable antiselection indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “tail” waggeth the canine evermore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How has senior management reacted to teleunderwriting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not to imply, of course, that senior management is by its nature (necessarily) reactionary, of course!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, 100% of respondents say the folks up the corporate food chain “love it” and no doubt all 18 survey-completers are pleased (or, at the very least, relieved) that this is so!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lastly, if you had it to do over again, would you adopt teleunderwriting? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All but 2 said yes… ….and one negative response is hereby discounted due to my awareness of its pathogenesis! Several appended comments, best summarized by, in the words of one, “teleunderwriting is THE WAY TO GO!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teleunderwriting Essay 9&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get into this critical issue in the success of your teleunderwriting program, there is an announcement that needs to be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABI Blesses Teleunderwriting! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Association of British Insurers issued a 12 page report in August which conferred its imprimatur on teleunderwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In it, the ABI recognized that teleunderwriting is in the best interests of British insurance applicants!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A brief report of this landmark development is posted at our web site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this important?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the ABI is a discerning organization that serves the interests of the public!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they endorse teleunderwriting, then we have achieved an important milestone which we can use to underscore the appropriateness of teleunderwriting if challenged by regulators, legislators and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s look at the issues regarding teleunderwriting and insurance salespersons…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…for whom there are more names than for medical records!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me clarify that by “salesperson” I mean “producers,” (the most common term of reference in the USA), brokers, intermediaries, advisors, agents…or whatever other (polite) term you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some years ago, I was asked to speak in the Canadian Province of Alberta to a meeting of producers. One of my topics was teleunderwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I presented the teleunderwriting concept… they booed me! Thank God they didn’t have empty beer bottles in their hands!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did they react so negatively?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were afraid – no, make that dead on certain – that teleunderwriting would encroach on their relationships with their clients, putting them at risk for losing the business (and, depending on the client, potentially a great deal more business) due to head office delays, insensitivities and nonspecific blundering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were their fears legitimate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At face value, you bet they are!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were a producer, I’m certain I would have had the same apprehensions when hearing that head office personnel – or worse, strangers (outsourced providers) – were going to deal directly with the source of my livelihood, before the premium (and my commission) was paid!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is the take-home message?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teleunderwriting can be a disaster if we drop the ball in terms of delays in contacting applicants, how consciously (and conscientiously) we interact with them and whether or not the net impact of the process provides a clear benefit to those who sell our insurance (and, one might add, in so doing create the need for underwriters in the first place!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A 4-Step Approach to Achieving an Enthusiastic Buy-In to Teleunderwriting by Your Sales Force &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STEP 1: Palms Up From Day One &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talk to the chief underwriter in any company that has enjoyed tremendous success with teleunderwriting and one of the first things you’ll hear is how glad he/she is that they got key people from the sales and marketing side involved early on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not just at the cusp of rollout…that’s way too late!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re talking about involving the RIGHT people from the start…defined as the first planning meeting to discuss the design of your program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because those who participate and have input from day one are far more likely to embrace the outcome than those who feel some newfangled scheme, concocted in secrecy, has just been dropped upon them!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most successful teleunderwriting- driven U.S. carriers took care to invite representatives of both the Marketing and Sales departments at head office in their preliminary planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also did one more thing…and it turned out to be a stroke of genius!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They invited one of their most successful sales people – in this case, a charismatic and highly-regarded (by her peers) woman who resided in the same city as the insurer (thus assuring maximum hands-on participation) – to join the Teleunderwriting Task Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three individuals gave constructive input – the net result of which made the teleunderwriting process better – and more importantly they became enthusiastic (and, as is their nature once energized, outspoken) advocates of the program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They kept their colleagues apprised of new developments as the project went forward (indeed, the salesperson was invited to write a column in the company’s employee and producer publication on the subject).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At roll out, they stood side-by-side with the chief underwriter and the CEO when the teleunderwriting program was previewed for the leading agents at their annual sales conference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take-home message: get the key people on the distribution side involved early, listen to their ideas and critiques, make their participation visible to their peers and use their buy-in to win over skeptics when…and after…roll-out takes place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STEP 2 : Ask “How Can Producers’ Most Likely Concerns Be Assuaged Through Teleunderwriting?” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Agents invest time and use skill to bring the customers to the point of filling out the application…then time passes – often lots of it – often six weeks or more, before the policy is approved. What happens next? Some 25% to 30% of the policies are never issued because the customers have lost interest, or changed their minds or some other salesperson steps into the picture and sells them a product that is delivered quickly. By reducing the approval process by just a couple of weeks, we could cut the default figures in half!” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron Verzone&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Best’s Review &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
October, 2003:100&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two major industry surveys of producers – published in 2004 and 2006 – revealed that the only issue that outranks application-to-issue turnaround time in the minds of producers is commissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact is, the two issues producers invariably have with underwriting are (1) it takes too long, and (2) it is too conservative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teleunderwriting doesn’t lead to a shift in basic underwriting philosophy, so the second concern is not going to be impacted directly (in truth, experience teaches that this perennial “hot button” is profoundly anecdotal, driven by their last case submitted and essentially incurable!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, just knowing that one of the main goals of teleunderwriting is to significantly reduce dependence on medical records will resonate with sales people…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…because they associate underwriter review of medical records with a higher probability of cases being rated, postponed or declined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where application-to-issue time is concerned, teleunderwriting is (or at least should be, in due course) their salvation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Make sure you place heavy emphasis on this signature payoff soon to come their way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only does teleunderwriting speed things up, it should also assure the demise of their nemesis: the “incomplete” application…you know, where one question somehow fails to get answered and the case goes into suspended animation until this technicality is dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time is money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my old friend Ron Verzone said, the longer it takes to issue a policy, the greater the risk that the client will lose interest. Moreover, the faster the policy is issued, the sooner the agent gets paid his commission. Don’t take these two considerations lightly…and make sure you tout them when you present your teleunderwriting program to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one more factor to consider here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producer liability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a producer, while taking down answers to the risk-related questions in the traditional application, fails to do his job properly, there can be ominous implications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recall a case I saw as a potential expert witness a few years ago. The applicant was the wife of one of the producer’s best clients. The producer knew the family well…so well, in fact, that he knew the wife – now applying for cover – had been “away” for a number of months earlier that year, tending to “a personal issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue was depression and he knew it, despite the delicate terms of reference!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it came time to answer the “mental and nervous” question on the application, he wilfully allowed it to be answered in a manner that was more than merely vague. Her answer did not reflect the true nature of the impairment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the producer took no steps to advise head office of what he knew to be true regarding her medical history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The policy was issued straightaway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The woman developed an aggressive, Rx- refractory lymphoma and died within the ensuing 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon review of the medical history, head office declined to pay the claim, because the true history of the electroshock-managed schizoaffective disorder was incompatible with insurability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guess who wound up on “the hot seat”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and almost lost his livelihood!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an ever-present risk that producers take when they intermediate the gathering of risk histories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A risk that ends the day teleunderwriting begins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STEP 3: Bang The Drums. Loudly! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to roll out teleunderwriting, make some noise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No…make A LOT of noise!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my consulting clients held a special event for leading agents; another did a series of events continent-wide so that even more producers could be present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was plenty of (frankly, gaudy) fanfare. The CEO opened the show and then introduced – of all people – me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was the “industry expert” assuring them that what their company was about to embark upon was the road to glory, already paved (and debugged) by others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, if things went awry, they had an outsider set up as the “fall guy”!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, the CMO, the director of sales and a producer who’d been intimately involved in the design of teleunderwriting all paraded up for short (well, in most cases) hosannas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the break, the chief underwriter reviewed the BEFORE vs. AFTER impacts teleunderwriting was sure to have on matters “near and dear” to producers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was also a virtual tour of the teleunderwriting process and the outsourced provider for teleinterviews also got into the act with a colorful presentation, strategically designed to allay as much concern as was possible about “outsiders mucking things up.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An updated Agents’ Guide to Underwriting was distributed. It not only upgraded descriptions of common impairments and their underwriting significance but also had an in-depth FAQ section on every conceivable issue producers might raise with teleunderwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, there were curmudgeons in the audience who sat snorting and grimacing, arms folded tightly across their chests…but they were far outnumbered by those who figured that if head office was investing this much in teleunderwriting, the least they should do is see if it worked…before griping!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bigger the SPLASH, the greater the impact!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STEP 4: Deal Promptly and Efficiently with Every Issue Raised in the Wake of the Roll-Out &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve worked more than 3 months with insurance sales people, you know the score.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They want their case-related concerns handled as promptly and as favorably as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can’t always deliver on the latter…but we can assign high post-roll out priority to prompt, decisive handling of producer questions and concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get through the first few months, during which most of your more active producers have had a few cases go smoothly (right?!) through teleunderwriting, things will get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because those first few cases are where attitudes toward teleunderwriting is shaped; then, in keeping with the nature of producers, cast in bronze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they have problems, they will blame teleunderwriting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if as many problems as humanly possible get addressed to their satisfaction early on, you can reinforce the message that teleunderwriting was the reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In time, even the most difficult producers will either be won over or find something new to grumble about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you set your benchmarks realistically, stay focused on those elements that matter most to producers and relentlessly send positive messages, then the demons you were certain you would encounter with “the distribution side” will soon evaporate…and a major benchmark for the success of teleunderwriting will have been achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I had a second encounter with those Canadian producers – this time at a regional event in British Columbia – and things went differently…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…as I savored long applause following my comments on teleunderwriting and how it has forged an even greater bond between those who sell insurance and those whose hard work and unique skills make that insurance affordable and ultimately worth having (us).&lt;/p&gt;
