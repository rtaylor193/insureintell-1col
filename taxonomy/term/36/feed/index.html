  <title>ALT and Muscle Trauma: What Every Underwriter Must Know</title>
  <link>http://insureintell.github.io/node/25637</link>
  <description>  &lt;div data-history-node-id="25637" class="layout layout--onecol"&gt;
    &lt;div class="layout__region layout__region--content"&gt;

    &lt;div&gt;Body&lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In the literature, there is still a pervasive lack of recognition between skeletal muscle injury and ALT elevation, which has led to the unsubstantiated conclusion that serum aminotransferase elevations are due to liver injury...”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahul A. Nathwani et al.&lt;br /&gt;
Division of Gastroenterology and Liver Diseases&lt;br /&gt;
University of Southern California School of Medicine&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hepatology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
41(2005):380-82&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time back, this underwriter reported in &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.hankgeorgeinc.com/JournalScan"&gt;JournalScan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; on a study done by military physicians proving that alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) does rise significantly in a subset of persons who engage in vigorous physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new paper by Nathwani and his coworkers at the University of Southern California – as cited above – confirms the importance of underwriter awareness of and attention to this seldom-appreciated reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Extreme exercise in their subjects drove up the ALT anywhere from 3- to 12-fold and even higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not as high as AST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOWEVER , it took ALT longer to normalize and this means we will see some applicants, 3 to 7 days after a major bout of exertion, whose AST will be normal while the ALT is still coming down (and thus, by inference, still elevated!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the face of exercise/muscle trauma-induced elevations, the AST:ALT ratio strongly favors AST in the range of 3 to 5 times the ALT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means that exercise may induce an AST:ALT ratio that could be easily mistaken for proof of alcohol abuse. This is true because, as all underwriters should know, when AST &gt; ALT on a blood profile, the likelihood – IN THE ABSENCE OF SUSPECTED MUSCLE TRAUMA – is heavy drinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In someone with chronic hepatitis B or C, or NASH (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis), an AST:ALT ratio &gt; 1 means the person probably has liver fibrosis, possibly even cirrhosis...a very unfavorable underwriting finding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does one confirm that an ALT elevation is of muscle damage origin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both total LDH and total CK also rise – dramatically, actually – in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GGT, on the other hand, is NEVER elevated by exercise or muscle trauma alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, if the GGT is also elevated, the likelihood of muscle trauma from heavy exercise being the culprit is greatly reduced (unless the proposed insured celebrates his physical activities with too many drinks on a regular basis!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the main way that we handle this is to be proactive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Underwriting Implications of this Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All underwriting guidelines for liver enzymes MUST RECOGNIZE that ALT is fully capable of elevating into the “PP” range due to significant exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All guidelines for client preparation for paramedicals with blood collections MUST ADVISE that individuals to be examined SHOULD:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Abstain from all exercise within 24 hours.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Not proceed with testing if they have participated in a very intensive period of exercise (weight training, bicycle marathon and so on) within 7 days of the date of the scheduled blood draw.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Forego blood testing if they have sustained any significant muscle injury as a result of an accident or any other form of trauma WHICH HAS NOT COMPLETELY RESOLVED IN TERMS OF SYMPTOMS AND PHYSICAL EVIDENCE (SWELLING, BRUISING, FRACTURES).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the guidelines for examinees from your paramed companies don’t include a strong admonition in this regard, tell them to make the change now. This will have a MUCH BIGGER impact on your underwriting than fasting before a blood sample is collected!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do these things (or) squander good business for avoidable reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
