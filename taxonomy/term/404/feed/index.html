              &lt;div property="schema:text"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late 2006, I was asked by a friend to create an e-dialogue with a 79 year old friend of hers whom we will refer to as “Patient MB.” This retired business executive had been diagnosed with desmoplastic melanoma several years earlier. When my friend happened to mention that she had a friend who knew a bit about melanoma, Patient MB asked to get in touch with me. As a result, he and I exchanged a number of e-mails and I wound up doing a fair amount of reading on desmoplastic melanoma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will get back to Patient MB’s case at the end of this article, when I turn the tables on you, asking your assessment of his insurability (which you should be able to provide based on what you are about to read!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“DM is a distinct form of cutaneous melanoma with unique histopathological features and clinical behavior.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katherine E. Posther, MD et al.&lt;br /&gt;
Duke University Medical Center&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Annals of Surgical Oncology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
13(2006):728&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is desmoplastic melanoma (DM) a common form of malignant melanoma (MM)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No – actually, it is relatively rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one series of 1850 melanoma cases, 3.5% were DMs. [Pawlik] In other reports, DMs accounted for &lt; 4% (Sydney, Australia) and &lt; 2% (Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, NY City) of melanomas, respectively. [Busam]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If DM represents such a small % of all melanomas, why bother learning about it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the volume of older age business increases, we will encounter more DM cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thick and deep DMs do not metastasize or cause death…which is distinctly different from what most underwriters know about typical melanomas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Certain key prognostic factors in DM differ from those we tend to think about in typical MM cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that underwriting guidelines focused specifically on desmoplastic melanoma are found in most manuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When was DM first identified as a distinct form of melanoma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not until 1971.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At what age is DM most commonly encountered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six studies report mean ages from 55 to 63 years old. The % of melanomas which are desmoplastic continues to increase with age beyond age 60. [Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the most common sites where DM arises?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over half arise in the head and neck region, along with 26% on the extremities and 21% on the trunk. [Lens]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does DM present?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The clinical appearance of DM can be highly variable and DM may mimic a variety of different lesions. Usually it has an innocuous clinical appearance and is described as an indurated discoid papule, plaque or nodule. Pigmentation is frequently absent, although a lentigo or lentigo maligna-like discoloration adjacent to the nodule is not uncommon.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marko B. Lens, et al.&lt;br /&gt;
St. James University Hospital, London&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;British Journal of Dermatology&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
152(2005):673&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Clinically, DMs present as slow-growing, indurated, painless and often amelanotic &lt;/em&gt;[non-pigmented]&lt;em&gt; palpable nodules.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katherine E. Posther, MD&lt;br /&gt;
Op. Cit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear from these descriptions that desmoplastic melanomas are at high risk for being either visually misdiagnosed or ignored altogether, which no doubt accounts for the fact that they are so often thick and deep at diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other growths may be mistaken for desmoplastic melanomas…and vice versa?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quite a few, actually, including some that are benign (dermatofibroma, blue nevus) and others that are either locally aggressive (atypical fibroxanthoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans) or overtly malignant (spindle cell sarcoma, cutaneous leiomyosarcoma). [Davison, Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do DMs have the usual microscopic features associated with melanoma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. They don’t look much like typical melanomas and hence erroneous pathological diagnoses are not uncommon, especially by community pathologists (as opposed to more expert pathologists in major cancer centers). [Lens]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often are they amelanotic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 40% of the time, as compared to only about 7% of typical melanomas. [Quinn]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ones that are amelanotic are most prone to being misdiagnosed either by observation or on microscopic evaluation. [Lens]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that amelanotic “typical” melanomas tend to be nodular rather than superficial-spreading and both thicker and deeper at diagnosis, as compared to pigmented melanomas…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…thus, the term “amelanotic” is a RED FLAG in all cases of MM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do DMs ever occur in conjunction with other melanotic lesions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, almost half of them – especially on the face – are associated with contiguous lentiginous-type melanomas, whether in situ or invasive…the latter being referred to specifically as “lentigo maligna melanoma” (LMM). [Quinn, Su]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there a benign “desmoplastic” nevus?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes…but it is also quite uncommon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benign lesion should be readily distinguishable by pathologists from DM based on 9 criteria…which we won’t list here (but you can find, if necessary, in the paper cited as “Busam” in the References section).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any variant forms of desmoplastic melanoma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, there are two distinctions made in this regard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DM may exhibit a pathologic feature called “neurotrophism,” which means that the tumor infiltrates nerves. Roughly 30% of DMs could rightly be called “neurotrophic desmoplastic melanoma.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, while these lesions are somewhat more prone to recurrence, this distinction does not appear to make a great deal of difference in terms of survival prognosis. [Arora, Busam]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other distinction is between “pure” vs. “mixed” DMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt; 90% of the tumor has typical desmoplastic features, most expert pathologists will label the tumor as a “mixed desmoplastic melanoma.” Mixed DMs tend to be thinner than pure DMs but there is little difference in their Clark level of invasion. Mixed DMs are also more likely (16% vs. 2%) to involve lymph nodes at diagnosis. [Pawlik]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some studies, there are prognostic differences cited for these variants. Overall, however, they do not matter significantly and the drivers of risk are other, more potent determinants yet to be discussed here…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What distinguishes the “margins” of a tumor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amount of normal tissue surrounding the edges of the tumor on all sides, as shown in the surgical specimen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are considered to be adequate margins?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In DM, experts prefer conservative margins, which most would define as ≥ 2 cm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How important are surgical margins when DMs are resected?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are the #1 factor determining whether or not the tumor recurs…and as you will see, recurrence is one of the areas of concern in DM. [Arora, Busam, Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do we find information about the surgical margins of the tumor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They are most commonly documented in the surgeon’s report…which is not the same as the pathologist’s report! [Posther]&lt;br /&gt;
This is important because underwriters often ignore the surgical report even when it is provided with the medical records…focusing their attention entirely on the pathology report instead!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the pathologist will make reference to the surgical margins, primarily in his “macroscopic” (rather than “microscopic”) description of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, there are times when you won’t find any comment at all about the surgical margins…which is unfortunate because of their importance in determining prognosis in DM (and other cancer contexts as well).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If surgeons understand the importance of margins, why would they be tempted to resect a DM with tighter margins?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because when the tumor occurs on the head or neck, cosmetic considerations are taken into account. By cutting it close (margins &lt; 1 cm), it is easier to achieve primary wound closure (without the need for a skin graft) and the likelihood of more satisfactory cosmetic outcome is enhanced. [Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do most DMs present as Stage I disease?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. Only about 30% are stage I…as compared to over 80% of typical cutaneous melanomas nowadays. [Quinn]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the average measured (Breslow) thickness of desmoplastic melanoma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study at the University of Michigan, it was 2.5 mm. However, in every other study we have seen, average thickness is ≥ 4 mm. [Arora, Busam, Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any “thin” DMs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By thin, of course, we refer to lesions &lt; 1 mm in measured thickness…and the answer is, yes, there are a few. In one series, 11% were classified as thin. [Arora]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does the probability of lymph node involvement (stage 3) correlate with greater measured thickness?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No…which is distinctly different from most other types of MM. [Lens]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the typical Clark level of invasion in DM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Level IV, which accounts for 55-70% of cases. Most of the rest (23-39%) are level V. [Lens, Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is tumor ulceration common?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No – less than 20% of DMs are found by the pathologist to be ulcerated. [Busam]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it common for DMs to have a high rate of tumor mitotic (cell division), as reported by the pathologist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. The majority will be described as having “moderate” mitoses (mitotic activity), which is usually defined as 1-4 mitotic figures per cubic millimeter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;High mitotic activity – a major adverse finding – is present in just over 20% of DMs. [Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the main form of treatment for desmoplastic melanoma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As in most melanomas, wide local excision is the primary intervention…and the only one that is considered curative in virtually all cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are other therapies ever given?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, radiation is sometimes used in DM because it appears to lower the rate of local recurrence. [Vongtama] The fact that radiation is offered does not make the case either more or less favorable…it all depends on the rest of the facts taken in CONTEXT!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patient MB told me he was offered treatment with interferon-alfa, a form of adjuvant therapy not considered much more than experimental in the studies I reviewed to write this article. This would concern me more than local radiation and I would want to know, directly from the oncologist, why it was offered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any treatments which would raise a definite RED FLAG?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Systemic chemotherapy&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Any other drugs or immunological agents&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Amputation (where this is feasible, of course!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And all of these, as well as radiation, would be tentative RED FLAGS in all other kinds of melanoma as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the local recurrence rate in DM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 703 cases summarized by Lens, 27% exhibited local recurrence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Posther’s study at Duke, 40% of 129 DMs recurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When do most recurrences take place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 75% are detected within 2 years of diagnosis of the primary tumor. [Quinn] However, they may arise fairly late in the course of DM, especially if the tumor was inadequately managed initially.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the #1 factor associated with local recurrence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Margins &lt; 1 cm. [Jaroszewski]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a series of patients where all cases had confirmed margins ≥ 2 cm, only 4% recurred over a median follow-up interval of almost 4 years. [Arora]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other factors have been associated with increased incidence of recurrence? [Lens]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Clinical misdiagnosis, resulting in delayed intervention&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Difficulties in analysis of pathology specimens&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High (Breslow) measured thickness&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Involvement of nerves (neurotrophism, neurotropic DM)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the other confounding consideration with apparent DM recurrence?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some lesions described as recurrences are just that, recurrences of the original primary tumor. Others are cutaneous metastases from the primary tumor. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult for pathologists to consistently make this distinction. [Busam]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are repeat surgeries (re-resections) more common in DM than in other types of melanoma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one study, 21% of DMs needed to be re-resected (mainly due to narrow margins) as compared to only 6% of typical melanomas. [Livestro]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is re-resection (second surgery) an important consideration in underwriting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because if it is done, there is a chance the findings will change the pathological assessment of the tumor…and, in some cases, its insurability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we have said countless times, underwriters need to be alert to the possibility of re-resection in all forms of skin cancer and especially MM. This should be on everybody’s “check list” to resolve on all melanoma cases!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does local recurrence increase the risk of subsequent lymph node and systemic metastases? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes…local recurrence (and even more so the presence of nearby cutaneous metastasis) is a key consideration in underwriting DM. [Jaroszewski]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How common are lymph node metastases in DM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Distinctly uncommon, as compared to most other kinds of melanoma. In one series of 102 cases, only 5 had positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies at diagnosis. [Busam]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a sentinel lymph node (SLN)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the lymph node which the surgeon determines to be the most likely one to which a melanoma will metastasize, based on the lymphatic system serving the region of the tumor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is an SLN biopsy done?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid the need for wider removal of lymph nodes (lymph node dissection) wherever possible. A lymph node dissection usually results in considerable morbidity; some of it permanent in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How common are regional and distant metastases in DM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“In contrast to the pattern seen generally for melanoma, the development of regional metastases was rare, incidence ranging from 0% to 18.8%. Systemic metastatic disease occurred in patients from 14 studies. The incidence of systemic metastases ranged from 7.4% to 43.8%.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marko B. Lens&lt;br /&gt;
Op. Cit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is overall disease-free survival in DM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a series of 129 cases, it was 71% at 2 years and 55% at 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this same series, overall survival (with and without residual disease) was 64% after 10 years, suggesting some patients with locally-recurrent but unresectable disease live for a protracted period of time. [Posther] This could be an important underwriting consideration at ages 75+, where baseline life expectancy may allow for consideration of some indolent cases with stable disease present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 3 earlier studies than the one by Posther and her Duke coworkers, disease-free survival ranged from 68% to 62% after 5 years. [Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When does the survival curve tend to “flatten out” suggesting that patients who live that long – free of disease! – have a favorable prognosis thereafter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the Duke study, this was shown after roughly 7 years…however, the number of cases followed that long was fairly small. [Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would it be accurate to say that, overall, the survival rate in DM is similar to that in typical MM?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes. [Livestro, Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this is a broad generalization and we need to get past it because there are distinct differences in terms of specific prognostic factors in DM, as compared to the superficial-spreading, lentigo maligna and nodular melanomas we usually see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where is the greatest divergence in long-term survival between typical MM and desmoplastic melanoma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In very thick (&gt; 4 mm) lesions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see relatively few long-term survivors with these thick lesions in typical melanoma. In DM, however, this is not always true and desmoplastic melanoma is always disproportionately represented in studies of long-surviving thick melanoma cases. [Spatz]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the key prognostic factors in localized desmoplastic melanoma?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two that are consistently significant on a multivariate basis (that is to say, after adjustment for the effect of the others):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Inadequate local excision/narrow margins [most studies]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;High tumor cell mitotic rate [Quinn]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Level V invasion and mixed (vs. pure) DM were each significant in at least one study [Busam and Mujumdar, Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does stage affect survival?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage I and II have similar overall survival rates, although disease-free survival is lower (52%) in stage II than in stage I (77%) at 5 years. This difference is considered only marginally significant. [Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does age at diagnosis matter?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subjects under age 60 have higher 5-year disease-free survival (64%) than those who are older (37%). [Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This said; remember that in melanoma (and most other kinds of cancer) 5 year survival is seldom an adequate benchmark for probable cure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is measured thickness significant?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, those &lt; 4 mm have somewhat better disease-free survival…but…the difference has not been deemed independently significant in most studies [Quinn, Posther]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The likely reason for this is that in typical melanoma, thick lesions have usually spread (resulting in a dismal long-term outcome) but in DM the risk of regional and distant spread is not well correlated with thickness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is ulceration a significant factor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No…and this is distinctly different from superficial-spreading and nodular melanoma. [Quinn]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Epilog: Patient MB’s desmoplastic melanoma&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the facts in the case I saw 2 years ago, dubbed “Patient MB”:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Current age:79&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Age at diagnosis:77&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gender: male&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Site of tumor: mid-back&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Gross description: 1 cm nodular lesion&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Differential diagnosis: DM vs. atypical melanocytic lesion vs. spindle cell sarcoma&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;S100 test positive (ruling out spindle cell sarcoma)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Depth of invasion: 2.5 mm&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Clark level IV&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Mitotic rate “low”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No ulceration present (per pathologist’s specific stipulation)*&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;No vascular or lymphatic invasion (again, as directly stated by the pathologist)*&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Margins described as “adequate” (without comment as to exact measurement)&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Atypical melanocytes present adjacent to tumor, described as consistent with noninvasive “lentigo maligna”&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Two other melanocytic lesions present elsewhere; both benign&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Re-resection of site found no residual tumor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* It is not sufficient to just assume that ulceration and vascular invasion are absent simply because the pathologist does not say they are present. In order to consider these significant findings to be absent in any given case, their absence must be specifically noted by the pathologist on his report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the foregoing facts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Would you insure patient MB now?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If not, would you consider him at some time in the future?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;If yes, when, assuming no interim recurrence?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will comment on this case in the February HOT NOTES for anyone who got this far reading this article and is interested!&lt;/p&gt;
